which they are now invested, will cement the union
between the two countries and provide tor those ca

Washington Cxtt, September 23.
By virtue of a precept of the secretary of the na
vy of the 12th inst. a court of enquiry will beheld
at Norfolk on the 5th October, in the case ofcom
modore Barron. The court will be composed of
the following officers, viz :
Captain Alexander Murray, President.
Captain Isaac Hull, and ( ^
Captain Isaac Clmuncey,
These gentlemen are the same with those previ
ously appointed, with the exception of commo
dore Preble, whose long illness and consequent
death prevented the court from setting at aa earlier
period.
From the London Times—‘■ Angastt.
The sitmtion in which this country is now placed,
of contending alone, or almost alone, with the enor
mous power of France, leads us naturally to review
the train of events by which we have arrived at so
perilous a predicament: not that we dread the en
counter, formidable as it may be, if our vigour is
"but fully exerted and ably directed , but because
danger is at all times to be avoided, if it can be a- •
voided with honour; and if the fate of so many
empires overthrown, and monatchs humbled, do not
drive us into despair, it should impel us to considera
tion ; if it do not cause us to tremble, it should
lead to reflection. The storm is just hanging ovpr
us; might we have got under shelter ? The danger
is at hand ; could we have kept it at a distance ?
Perhaps we may he considered as incompetent judges
in our own case, let us recur to the sentiments of,
otheis. France and England are playing a despe
rate game: what are the opinions of those around,
as to the skill we have exhibited, and the talents we
have displayed ? And here we cannot but regret, and
Jlave had liequeht occasion to mention, that this
©pnion is not so greatly in our favour, or so highly
partial to our cause, as under another, line of con
duct we might have had reason to expect. Conti
rental Europe, with what justice we shall soon see,
rings with accusations of our inertness. Our ene
mies sneer at it; and our friends are astonished at
the frustration of their hopes, and the disappoint-*
m^nt of those expectations of assistance, which ei
ther we had promised them, or they had promised
themselves, or, at all events, the exigency of their
aflkirs seemed but too imperiously to demand. The
words of the French Ambassador, .at the court of
Saxony, pre\ intis to the Prussian war, have been fa
tdly verified, “that England did nothing forTcr
Ailies." Our foreign ministers have been harrassed,
and nor envoys perplexed, with the incessant repeti
tion of the dir'.ressmg questions : “ Where are the
English troops? When will they arrive? Why do
they not come ?” The mother of Sjsera could not
feel greater ; nxiety for the return oLiier son, when
she looked out at the lattice, and taxed the slow
ness of his chariot wheels^ and the result has been
the same in Loth cusps ; neither her son returned
tome, or a British Expedition reached the continent.
Frequent disappointment produces indifference > "and
with that feeling, or rather absence of feeling, it
may he feared is our present situation viewed by our
late allies. Nay more: when to the disappoint
ment which they have experienced -from—there
friends, we add likewise, the overthrow they have
sustained from their enemies, we ought not to be
surprized if apathy is roused to hatred, and indiffe
rence kindled into contempt. But to whOtn are we
to attribute this ? “ Our cause, (as Hotspur says,) a
good cause, our friends firm friends," who has occa
sioned this woeful falling off, both of kind wishes,
and active to coperation ? The late, or the present
ministry ? This matter was agitated with great ta
lent, and peculiar interest, in the house of Com
mons, last Friday night, each party wishing to shift
the blame upon the other, or endeavouring to at
tribute what bus happened to the irremediable course
of things. In physical events, indeed, nature predo
minates, and little is left to human agency; hut
■where great moral evils occur, no such overwelming
necessity exists, as to free the persons implicated in
them from being answerable for the disastrous results.
They may be prevented, by the hand of man, be
cause by the hand of man they are produced. To
what is the successes of Buonaparte on the conti
nent to be attributed, Int to prudence, energy, fore-’
thmipht, celerity, valour ; and why has it not been
arrested, but for the want of these qualities irv his
, opponents? VVe chuse to call them quUlftiefe, and
rut virtues, lest we should be thought partial to the
enemy of our country. Is it not then singular
that the portion of these hitherto exerted ou the.
part of the allies has been so small, as to hav«i affor
ded scarcely any obstruction' to the rapidity of his
conquests ? and does no blame attach from this ob
servation to the government of this country, as a
party concerned iti the war? That war, with all its
unfortunate train of events,'commenced in October
last ; «ind.as the time, from that period to the bat
tle of Fiicdlattd, has been in some measure divided
between the last and'present administiation, our
sbafeof the culpability, whatever it iriay be, that
results from the sinister turn of events, may per
haps be justly assigned, in. the same proportions,
»o them both. Continental politicians, indeed, and
foreign cabinets may reprobate our. inactivity, as
the sole cause of their' misfortunes. But this, il
they consider the matter rightly, in speaking with,
equal severity of themselves and us : for what can
he said more contemptible of a man, than that, hr
d^tf not put forth the whole powers in his own pre
servation, because he trusted 16 the assistance, ol
others ? However, let us nut retort accusation upon
accusation : misfortune ought to procure exemption
ihjm reproof; and while we spare. tconuuenting on
vbeir faults, they ought not to rejoire iu our difficul
ties, or promote the views of our enemies;
Thewhole'sum'df our,offending is this, lhattdu
ring the eight months in which they have been en
gaged in this uqhapy content, we have done nothing
in the cnmnfhn. cause: we bare not dispatched a
ship fioni our ports, or a man from our army, ex
cept oa expeditions, tending exclusively to our own
interest. \Ve have attempted no diversion, we’have
IWi(ed in no co-operation. Now, ctitainly Uua is a
matter wfciA i£wonTd M dWSwfTt t® explain* iratis
tactot ity tothutfe Who ihiri^ they Rave suffered by
our seltisimegsortupineuess : but,, as- we feel anxi
ous that oof- country should stand well id- the- esti
mation of the'states of Europe. we shall endeavour
to urge sue h circumstances in palliation of our o f
lence, as we think will have some tendency to dimi*
nish the acrimony with which we are now spoken
oi <>n the continentand we think that our Accu
sers are peculiarly interested'iii hearing what_may
he said in this behalf, inasmuch as we are convinced^
and so must they be too, oa calm deliberation, that
if, from pelulenee or revenge, our late Allies are in
cited to enter voluntarily into an engagement against
us, they are ultimately seeking their own ruin.
In the first place, then, it does not appear by the'
debate of .Friday night, that any express promise
was ever made on our part of sanding tfoops-tr> the
continent. Implied it Certainly was, that we should
do our utmost .in the common Cause, we wish most
earnestly that the hopes, resulting from such an im
plication, had been fully’ gratified: it would have
shewn ati ardour and -sincerity which would have
rendered the desertion of us the greatest of politi
cal crimes. But it must be allowed, that weigh
ty difficulties stqpd in the way of a continental
expedition. For, secondly, we will defy those who
reprobate, our want of energy, to point out any plan
of conducting this expedition; any time for its set
ting out, any place foi its landing, any object with
in the reach of its attainment, which will not be
subject to weighty, (we will not say insuperable, be
cause we think the thing ought to have been tried)
but which will not be subject to many and weighty
objections. Joint cb-operatiotr, the Russians did
not want ; they deprecated the union of our troops
with theirs. Of expeditions to Holland the nation
has had enough. Well, but we might have landed
in Pomerania, joined the king of Sweden, attacked
the enemy in his rear, cut oli his supplies, or oblig
ed him to- reduce his army by detachments. But,
first, it is not the custom of Buonaparte to divide
his army ; he would have pursued the force before
him with all bis powers; and after their defeat,
■ ■avc lumen win an dis powers upon us. Besides,
the greatest possible success in . Pomerania would
not have enabled us to advance far, Spandaa, Mag
deburg, Berlin, and all the fortresses in Prussia,
were garrisoned and prpvisoned for sieges, by the e
a few weeks after the battlp of Jena;
and why might not Buonaparte have pursued the
allies, just as he has done, into Poland, and left us
to waste pur strength all the winter before these
places "
But we might have intercepted his supplies, and
cut off his resources ? as well might yob talk ot dry
ing up the Thames at London Bridge ; by destroy
ing one of the springs that feed it in Gloucestershire.
The line of his resources, and route of bis army of
reserve, were infinitely too deep in the continent for
our reach. ' He generally drew his supplies from
the conquered countries where he was actually pre
sent ; and whatever came to hkn from France, pas
sed through Flanders, and across the bridges of the
Rhine, where a British army has never appeared
with effect since the days^of the duke of Marlbo
rough. ' \
Might we not then have had an armament in the
Baltirk, to attack his left flank, and support the
right of the allies ? to this it may be replied, that
the grand engagements happened in inlaud places,
at Jena, at Eyluu, and at Friedland ; where troops
| landed from transports, and supported-by gw*-boa*s,
I could not generally have gone; and then as to the
siege of Dantzick, the fall of which it is said we
might have prevented, pray let us ask in return,
and we ask the question, not with a view to recrimi
nate, but merely to show that others have commit
ted errours as well as us ; had the emperour of Rus
sia no ships atCronstadt, during the siege of Dant
z:c ? and is not the gulph of Finland as nenr the
scene of actions the British channel f
Tbese-are the general advatttage»wlwcb-it is sup
posed the allies might have derived from the more
active energy of Great-Britain. The observations
that We made on them cannot, perhaps, wholly ex
culpate us, but at least they shew that the acrimo
ny with which we hear"that the British name is eve
ry whefe-treated on the continent, tracscehds the
hounds of our ottence; this severity of remark
springs from the bitterness of disappointment, and
thatagain is aggravated by the extravagant hope's
W huh have been preposterously indulged. It is pain
ful to' as tp hear th^t* the fair uame of the nation is
traduced, or its fair lame aspersed j arid we hope
what we have urged in its defence, will reach as far
as the' criminutioir extends. But it it is not by
wolds only, hut by deeds that we are attacked ; if
our late illustrious ally, disgusted" bey ond reason and*
prudence at our .rermssness, co-operate in any plan
subversive of our rights, or even hostile to our com
merce, the evil will uot rest with us; but will as
cend to the author of it; for the empeioftr Alexan
der may rest assured that tht? “ freedom of the seas,"
i! it is once obtained, will only open to those who
wiK most assuredly be bis enemies again, anpther
way to the Rpssian cupilal. , , ,

B}' the Ann,, from;, Bordeaux, we have received
french papers to the 1st August.
Bordeaux was illuminated for three nights oi» ac
count of' the peace.
The French emperour Buonaparte arrived at Pa
ris the 27th July, from the grand army. The re
joicings and illuminations on this occasion, were
the most extravagant of any thing of the kinrf.wc c

- **•• f- Paris, July 20.
Yesterday, at four o’clock inthe afternoon, agree
Hhly to the order of bis majesty the emperor and
King, his serene highness the prince arch chancel
lor of the. empire, repaired to the senate, in order to
communicate to its members the two treaties of
peace signed with Russia and Prussia.--*
His serene highness was received with the accus
tomed ceremonial, and having taken' his' seat, he
said, . . , , _ ,
“ Gentlemen, tht .rapid course of the-vie lories
of his majesty, the emperour and king, was the cer
tam onifn »t & glorious peace.—Our hopes are ac
complished by the. two treaties of. peace which' 1
bring to the senate, fits majesty would not suffer
them to'be made publick until they were laid before
jou. 'l ire senate duly Appreciate the delicacy 01
f hts reserve, and it will perceive therein a new prom
of the iitteiiiionor opr Hiignst sovereign^ in main
taining the forms ^Qpsecruied by custom and oui
|aws. . '.i.;; .
“ Amidst the great results which these political

tleincu, to lbe glory of the imperil dynasty, with
what satisfaction will you not seeits splendour con
tinually increasing, elevate to the throne of West
phalia, a young prince^’whose w isd. ior'anrf'1 ooraigp
have just been signalised by deeda so^uotih*: lh
that, us well as in every (fther disposition forming
these treaties, you will trare, gentlentenv the con*'
slant-cares ot the founder of the empire, to consoli
date the great systemof which he has ikitf the Basis.
Your hearts will applaud the conceptions of a genius
friendly to humanity, whose views and precautions
all tend to spare the effusion of human blood. The
continent may at lengths calculate upon a durable
peace. The memorable interviews which have just
taken-place on the borders of the Niemen, are the
pledges of loBg tranquility. The tokens of mutual
esteem and confidence which have been established
between the sovereigns of the two most powerful na- ]
tions of Europe, present a warrantry against which
all the efforts'of hatred’ and- ambition, wiM hencefor
ward prove abortive.”
His serene highness having then handed the two
treaties, tiiey were read by senator Dupere, one of
the secretaries.
The reading being ended, the senator Lacepedc,
speaker of the seuaie, made the following reply :
“ My lrtrd. the reading of the two treaties of
peace,, which, his majesty the emperor and king, has
been pleased, through your serene highness, to com
municate to ns, impress upon the senate new g«nti
jnents of the liveliest gratitude. >
** After so many harvests of glory, sir many pro
digies, and so much good, the senate feels more than
ever the necessity of presenting to liis Imperial and
loyal majesty its homage and its vows.
“We know We shall soon have the advantage, so
precious-for .every Frenchman, of enjoying the au
gust presence of the greatest of mon'archs. But
days, hours and even moments, seem like so manv
ages to our just impatience.
“ I"ttaen move, senators, 1st. that the senate or
ders the transaction upon its registers of the trea
ty w‘th Russia-, and of that with Prussia. 2'd. that
a special committee be charged to draft an address
expressive of the sentiments of love and respect
with which the senate is so* deeply affected for his
imperial and royal majesty." \ *-V; ■
The two motions of senator Lacepede, were una
nimously agreed upon.
1 he committee appointed1 to frame the address,
consists of bis eminence Cardinal Fesch, Messrs.
Lacepede, Monge, Laplace, and Semonville. They
will make their report on Monday, the 27th inst. ”
_ Conformably to orders from his majesty, the em
perour and king, transmitted to his serene highuess
the prince arch-chancellor of the empire, his excel
lency the grand master of the ceremonies, prescrib
ed to, the heralds to proclaim in Paris, the peuce
which has just been signed with Russi&and Prussia.
*kjsPjfkLcation has taken place yesterday 24»h Ju
ly, as follows :
At 5 o clock, in the evening, the heralds on horse"
back, attended by 24 justices of the peace and a
numerous detachment of troops, set off from the
Thuilleries, and proclaimed throogbout Paris, the I
articles- of the treaties concluded between his roa- i
jesty the emperour of the French and king of Italy,!
protector of the confederation of the Rhine, and
their majesties the emperour of all the Russians and
the king of Prussia.
The train in all its rounds Was followed by an
immense concourse of people, who evinced their
gladness and gratitude by the liveliest transports
and cries a thousand times repeated, oftrive Vempe
ruur. In the evening there was a grand illuminati
on.
The emperotir is expected here to-moi row or the
day following, it is supposed be will go direst to |
St. Cloud.- ; ' ■'

Hu majesty the emperor sat oft horn Konings

rived on the 14th at noon’, at Marienwerder, wheie
he staid an hour. At 12 o’clock the same evening,
he passed thro’ Posen, where he remained two
hours; during which he received the civil officer*
ot the Polish government.
On the l6tb, at noon, he arrived at Glogpu, and
on the 17th, at seven in the morning, at BauUen,
first town ot the kingdom of Saxony, where he was
received by the king. These two sovereigns con
versed together tor some time in the mansion house
of the bishop; the king entered in the emperor’s
carnage, they arrived together at Dresden and
alighted at the palace. This day at 6, in the
morning, the emperor mounted on horseback (4.sur

The sentiment? which his majesty found in Sax
