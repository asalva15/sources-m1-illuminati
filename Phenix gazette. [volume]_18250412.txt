_POETRY.
The following' soft and descriptive SONG is
from the pen of Ccvsivr.iuM, the pastoral
poet; and a more beautiful description can
not be found in the works of Theocritus or
Virgil:
O’er moorlands and mountains, rude, barren,
As wilderM and wearied I roam, (and bare,
A gentle young shepherdess secs iny despair,
And leads me o’er lawns to her home.
Yellow sheaves from rich Ceres her cottage
had crown’d,
Green rushes were strew’d on the floor;
Her casement sweet woodbines crept wanton
ly round,
And deck’d the sod seats at her door.
We sat ourselves down to a cooling repast,
Fresh fruits, and she cull’d me the best,
TUI, thrown from my guard by some glances
Love slily stole into mv heart. [she cast,

(Ye virgins, her voice was divine!)
“ I*vc rich ones neglected & great ones denied,
But take me, fond shepherd, I’m thine.”
Her uir was so modest, her aspect so meek,
So simple, yet sweet were her charms?
[ kiss’d the ripe roses that grow’d on her check,
And lock’d the lov’d maid in my arms.
Now jocund together wc tend a few sheep;
And if, on the banks of yon stream,
Reclin’d on her bosom, l sink into sleep,
Her image still softens my dream.

The cottager, Fence, is well Known iu tier sire;
And the shepherds have named her Content.

MISCELLANY ■
The following romantic account of an initi
ation into the mysteries of the Jacobins, is ta
ken from tic second scries of Mr. Ghattan's
highly-amusing work entitled “Highways and
Bvways.”—The well-authenticated Histories
of the* German Illuminati, render it probable
that this detail is not altogether fictitious'—
“Cornelius stopped for awhile in the
narrow path, on the brow of the hill, a
long which his companion led the way;
and while he contemplated the calm
beauty of the scene, and felt as it his
whole thoughts could smoothly float
on the silver-surfaced stream, he was
roused by Armand, who stopped short
and said aloud.—
‘Now, citizen, we are arrived, in
the name of liberty advance and enter.
“Cornelius started at the summons,
but recollected instantly the purpose
he had in mind, and with unhesitating
step he followed close upon his guide.
They entered a ca\ity in the earth, al
most wholly concealed by branching
shrubs, and Armand having whisper
ed some watch-word, a man dressed in
black received them in silence, and mo
tioned them to pass on. The passage
was narrow and w inding, dimly light
ed at intervals by melancholy lamps,
w hich shone on the dark walls, and
shewed occasionally grim ornaments ol
skulls and bones. They penetrated far
into one of those excavations which
are formed allalongthc face of the hill,
and which were originally intended for
wine vaults, and mostot tnem useci as
such. In the depth of one of these re
cesses, the society ol the illuminati
held their secict meetings. Every
thing which could impose on the minds
of the weak, or rouse the imagination
of the enthusiastic proselyte, was studi
ed in the decorations of the cavern coun
cil-chamber and its approaches. Dim
lights, black hangings, scattered in
struments of death, and mementoes of
mortality, were displayed in scanty and
solemn arrangement. Armand led on
followed by Cornelius, who felt no sen
timent but contempt for the imposing
mummery; but at length when they
reached au opening space which Ar
mand announced as an anti-chamber
of the council room, our hero started
with horror, and felt his blood run chill
as he observed three or four naked
corpse lying on the floor, in the breast
of each of which a dagger was stuck,
while from each a stream of blood ran
trickling.
“ Armand saw his emotion, and smi
led. He felt a species of triumph in
momentary expression of alarm, which
Cornelius’s face displayed. But the
latter construed his smile in a different
sense. He thought he saw in it the re
joicing treachery of a murderous inten
tion: He shrank back, and turned his
head round with the view of flying
from the place, when he observed two
men dressed in black, with naked
swords in their hands, who had follow
ed silently, and made retreat impossi
ble. They said, with an encouraging
expression of countenance, ‘fear no
thing, citizen; this is but a preparation
for the test of your courage and virtue.’
Do not hesitate nor doubt me,
(whispered Arm and:) be firm, or you
are lost.’
+' With these words he knocked at a
door before them, and on his replying
still in whispers to some questions from
within, it opened, and he and Cornelius
once admitted, it closed again, with a
sudden sound, that was like the echoing
sentence of eternal imprisonment.
Three men of fierce aspect sat at
a table; their looks glanced wildly
through their raven locks, and seemed
to tell a story of ferocious thoughts and
deeds. The chamber was, like the ap
proaches to it, faintly lighted and sadly
adorned. A book lay on the table, with
writing materials. Three or four dag
gers were its only other furniture, and
their blades were steeped in blood.
“ A few rapid questions were propo
sed to Armand, as the name, age, and
quality of the friend whom he thus in
troduced for admission to the society.
These answered, and entered in the re
gister, which lay on the table, Corneli
us was asked if he was ready to gi\c
his first proof of his patriotism, his de
votion to t! c cause of freedom, and
Ins hatred ot his toes, tie answered
in the affirmative ;and then it was de
manded of Armand whether he was
willing to set the example to his friend
of the deed which he would be called
upon to perform. Armand replied
that he was, and on the word, a curtain
was drawn, woicfi disclosed n cave still
darker than the other, from the undis
tinguishable depths of which low
groans was heard to proceed. They
became gradually louder, and finally a
blood-stained couch was biought for
ward by two men, and on which lay
bound another, writhing in apparent ag
ony.
Take the dagger, brother, (said
the piesident in a hollow yet fierce tone)
Take the dagger, and strike the Aris
tocrat to the heart.’
“ Ann and seized the weapon, and
advanced towards the couch. The
man who lay on it, and who seemed
suffering under the infliction of tor
ture, no sooner saw the uplifted wea
pon, than he uttered a shriek, which
seemed to - pierce Cornelius’s heart,
and screamed aloud for mercy !
“ ‘ No mercy for the Aristocrat—no
hope for the Royalist, (cried Armand;)
blood, blood, in the name of our coun
try and our revenge!’ and with the last
word he struck the dagger full against
the suppliant’s breast. A stream of
blood followed the weapon as he drew
ii back—a deeper groan issued from
the body, and both executioner and vic
tim were instantly concealed by the
black curtain which fell between them
and the witness of the deed.
“Cornelius stood shocked with aston
ishment and horror. A few minutes of
dreadful silence passed over when the
curtain was slowly raised, and the mute
attendants carried forth a dead body,
the poignard fast in its bleeding bo
som. Thev passed the door, and Cor
nelius’s heart sunk as he heard the dead
weight of the corpse fall on the eai
then floor
“ i he coucn was again uiuugm. mi - j
ward, and on it lay another man, appar
ently more exhausted or more firm
than the first, for he only heaved heavy
sighs, and but half turned his pallid
face,and scarce open eyes, with indiffer
ence or insensibility on the scene.
“‘Now, citizen, take the dagger and
rid the country of one enemy more, es
stablishing your right to her gratitude
and our confidence. Take up the dag
ger,’ cried the president.
“ Cornelius in the abstraction of ter
ror, seized the weapon—advanced as it
were instinctively towards the couch
—raised his arm while his brain retied
_but started in instantaneous recollec
tion of the scene before him and of the
deed he was about to commit 1 he
dagger was falling from his hand, when
the prostrate man called to him in a
smothered whisper, inaudible or unno
i ticed by the persons at the table, and
the mute attendants,‘Strike tearlesly,
Cornelius—It is I, Arm and—there is
no reality in your blow; I wear a cors
let, and your dagger’s blade runs up in
to its own hilt.—strike !’
“ A quick conviction flashed across
“Cornelius’s mind. He saw all was a
hideous trick to try the nerves of the
proselytes. He struck at fhe bosom of
the pretended victim. The groan is
sued, and the blood flowed—and the
curtain fell between him and the coun
cil chamber.
“ Armand sprang upon his feet, and
was with our hero hurried by the
mutes into another room, where bril
liant lights showed a party of upwards
of a hundred young men, carousing,eat
ing, drinking and enjoying themselves
in strange contrast to the frightful or
deal through which the nninitiated
were made to pass, inis uiuckcij ui
blood and horror was used, as Corne
lious had surmissd, to prove the cour
age and desperation of those who
wished for admittance. Those who
had gone through the trial acted the
parts of the sacrificed Aristocrats*
Dead bodies were procured from the
hospitals and burial grounds, and dan
ger to the actors avoided by spring
daggers, and concealed breast-plates
w hile bladders containing blood were
m ade to burst by the harmless blows.
“After these initiatory horrors,
which many of the highly-excited
youths would, in the hey-day of repub
lican frenzy, have gloried in had they
been real, the newly-admitted member
was all at once introduced into the
scene of lestive enjoyment before de
scribed. Beyond that there was no
thing terrible. An oath of patriot
ism and secrecy, a signal communica
ted, a certain sum deposited to aid the
general fund—and all the ceremonies
of installation were completed.”

AGRICULTURAL.
Extract from the Proceedings of the .‘Igricultu
ral Society of .Ubermurle County, Va.
Monday, Oct. 11, 1824.
The following report from a Com
mittee appointed for the especial pur
pose, was received, read, and after some
amendments, adopted by the society; Sc
ordered to be published in the Central
Gazette, and the American Farmer.
The Committee appointed at the
last meeting to prepare and report a plan
for an Agricultural Exhibition and Fair
to be held by the Society in the autumn
of 1825, have given to the subject all
the consideration which in their opin
ion, is due to it, from the unlimited
discretion conferred on them, in their
appointment. Regarding it mainly, as
an attempt to revive the zeal and ex
ertions of the Society; which much to
our reproach, has been too long dor
mant. Considering the subject as nov
el and untried among us, and having a
due regard to the actual funds of the
Society, the committee in recommend
ing a first essay, are induced to limit
the exhibition to a few subjects most
conformable to the objects which the
Society has in view, and best calcula
ted in their opinion to attract public at
tention.—These consist:
1st. Of Agricultural Implements, and parti
cularly the Plough the perfection of which
ought to claim our first attention, as it is the
chief instrument for dividing the soil, and of
course the basis of all our Husbandry.
2d Fine Breeding animals, calculated for
the saddle or draft, for food or clothing, which
will comprehend horses and mules, neat cattle,
hogs and sheep.
wliirh thf» In.
dies of our state will not be excluded from a
due participation in our exertions, or a patriot
ic and praise worthy emulation ui that branch
of industry which is likclv to become the only
source of clothing' left'to the Agricultural
States of the Union, if we may be allowed to
judge from the efforts of the last session of
Congress, to diminish our imports, by an in
creased tariff of duties. These will compre
hend fabrics wrought of wool and cotton, ci
ther separate or mixed, of flax and of Hemp.
Your committee are aware that there
are many other subjects eminently en
titled to the Society’s encouragement—
but at present they will confine their
recommendation to those above enu
merated, and now submit the following
scheme:
The Society will hold an Exhibition

nutes. P. MINOR, Scc*y.
We perceive by a letter from Samuel
Preston, esq. of this state, to the editor
of the New-England Farmer, that the
former gentleman has succeeded in
raising two crops of potatoes in one
year from the same tttd. Our farmers
would do well to notice the ^sult ot
this experiment, and bear in mind that
it was only produced from choosing
the very largest potatoes for seed, and
planting them .U Potatoes> are we
believefthe most profitable crop that
the farmer raises, and we seldom hear
ofany complaint of a want of sale for
this noble esculent.—[U. Statu Ga..
