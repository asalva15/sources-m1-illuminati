DEDICATION to the PUBLIC.
vrHEN the following pages were committed
to the preis, it was the with and expert?i-i(>n of the
Author to remain in obi v o >. A variety of eattfes
have poftponed it» tpprJtntnff ; and anieRur, ever
b*ly. *ud mriqjfty erre prying, have lifted up the
veil ot Concealment, and many are acquainted with
h; m«i ar.d fitua*.ion which (hror.dtd in an i^>py
oigdiociity, it wik hoped would'hare (leaped the
notice of th* world. B*IIL«j u th’R her favturrite
w.:n, the ttcl» it a tftttv to anotogiy.e with her very
hum a! r talent *, for ih^fs ar>p<anng in public. She
very wcil k inVI that wrjttrs of Romance are nut
highly iftirnaud. She is hkenife fr.diblcthat cuf
»om and natuie, which have affixed the ditties of
woman to a very tDnflned and vety limited bounds,
arc by no means I kely ro patronize a fcinaie wri
ter. She feels that her Condtict needs exculr, and
though the indvpend< .ice ot her mind renders her
unwilling to trukc o yet neceflity obliges her to
it. She ia lo certain that U> many will acknowl
edge the truth at her RflVrtiun, th.it Iht docs not
htfttate to d'clare, that not one I >cial or domef
nc duty, have ever been faerifl 'ed or poftponed bv
herp-n; and though it may be dhie&td thattfrr
time devoted to it, might have been better employ
ed ; She hopes that Mir may be allowed in fame
tefpeCls, to be a judge of her own conduct; her
p. n has always been a favourite implement j it has
foothed many rttlamboiy, and fwcetcncd many bitter
hottra. Her abilities aic too icanfy to allow htr to
twrdtrftand either religions or philofophtcal fnbjctfs
in other*, much more inadequate to the attempt
ing them herfelf; incapable of undertaking the
labor* of hiftory. or ofattaiginc the fubhme heights
of poetry ; the only path which lay open, was that
of Romance. The Revolution in Fiance, and
the perturhated ftale of Etn *v, hare opened fome
femes, that would without thele amazing fkocks
to the political world,have lain hid in obfeurity; to
lome ot thefg .he has had recourse, and msnyi very
many ferious truth are interwoven with the ftocy
at* Jolt A. It may pci haps he nbjtttjtd, that the
annah of our own country d.J'play a v,ift field for
the 'magmat rip, an I that we need oofs tbei
allantic in .fearch of materials to found the mora
t ale or amufing ft iry upon. But an aferfion to in
tipducc living Cha..'.,‘ters or rhoft recency dead,
rtndcrcd Europe a fatc-r, thcUeh ont a more acrer
abb heatre. With ml humility, and t n trembling
diffiu. nee, this little work is prefenterf to the pub-’
he, arid as a imd.ocritv of genloils,will not author-,
ire a hope for th«- anp-oh.ition of the conooiMVur ;
.that it may be th.clded from the cenfure of the
critic, ir.ail that, if ~xptftrd. It comes like the
humble Ji'LfA, ful'utmg patronage and pcotetfHon
as a boon that mM enftjrtr its ftubefs, not demand
ing as a due, what perhaps it wiM not be found to
