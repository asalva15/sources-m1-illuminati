Chiun, Secretary, a county meeting iva* held in
the Court House on Monday last, the Mtii S pteni

relation to the Tariff', which lately look place in

the meeting to order, .m l on mu.iou, John Brad
Ion!, Ksq. was appointed Chairman, and Capt. Ash
tou Garrett, Secretary—Major Barry addressed
the Chair and remarked, tliai as the inerting hud
been called atliie suggestion of the friends o7 the
Administration, who professed to bo the friends of
tlie American System, it would, perhaps, tic ex
pected from sonic gentleman on that >i to of the
question to bring forward some mich propositions
as might appear to them appiopri.ito to the occa
sion. lie would, therefore, wait to hear from them;
hut it they would not come forward, that the pro
positions would be offered from the other side.
No gentleman having rerponded to the call,
General M’Caliu rose and offered the following re
solutions:
1. Rerolvcd, That it is (lie opinion of this meet
ing, that the ( uustitiition ot the United States has
given toCongress the power levy duties upon
foreign imp >il# for tho purposes of revenue and
the protection and encouragement of our home in
dustry.
it. Resolved, I hut v. In! f a h.ir difference of o
pinion as to the extent of'protection in the det ail
should be indulged, lh.it eurourngement should be
given to our agriculture and manufactures so far
as not to create monopolies, nor to enrich 011c cla.-s
by the inipovcriduiu'jit of another class.
H. Resolved, That we lament the excitement,
which has been produced by the passage of thelaUi
^ aril) bill, in the Mates of .Maine, Massachusetts,
Mew Voik, South Carolina and Georgia, which, in
bno quarter, li *. h*d to ilisie-p^ellul ciinduct to

<U Resolved, 'J hat we rjnnat and will not for
one moment, doubt die patiuti-m and attachment

in the North or fUi.;h,i:i consequence of ti,e in
temperate conduct of a lew overheated citizens in

FAYETTE COUNTY MEETING.
To the Editor of the A'l-nluef.;/ Ciasrtle.
“ ;i: Having attended the public meeting at
••lie Courthouse on Monday last, i cannot retiain
from giving you n brief, though an imperfect
sketch of what occurred, and especially an out
fine of the very eloquent speech made by Mr. i
B n ry on that occasion. I ■hall be merely able to '
give an ouiline of that interesting address, and i
leave it to the imagination of my readers to fill up!
ne pioliue; lor, to doit complete justice, I lie pen !
vbould have the satm; inspiration with the tongue1
that spoke it,
Wlu f, the hell rung in the evening, the people
a-jjtnblcd evi'cntly under some excitement.—
•lie friends ol (I rier.d Jack son expected to meet
■ »c frier ids of Mr. Adam*, and to canvass freely
-iid boldly the important ruhjeef to which the pub
lic attention hud l>eon direct* d. The meeting was
1 ifge and highly i rpi-rtsble t’n the motion ol
Judge Jtluhoe, John J»todjoidt Jlsy. on*; of (be
>if*t si ’’.lets **t Lexington, and among the firmes?'
i*‘|iiiblies.n» It contain*, w .s < ,(»| j m’u,e ehsii.—
A more appropriate selection could not have been I
made, fie was among tho«e who opts -*-d the j
luurpalions of (ha first Adams, ard «t x/d by the !
t ie of Nicholas io pto-notlng lha* great civil r<* \
vjlution which restni"d (:> the people «ficti lights i
placed the Republic once more in security.— !
The. meeting l>ri* »* fully organized, Mr. lWtj ,
rose and refnarketi* that it had been called at the
1 islaflfoo ?hx ?*- n ”■ n cnjjipr 'eo of Env-i
Iette (utility, ihiougn uic columns of tl.e Kcpovtei,
|*hat cad li nt l ecu responded toby the triends ol
J Andrew Jackson, through th* Uaxettc They, lie
1 remarked, wore now present, and ready to meet
any proposi'ion which the friends of Mr. Adams
wight tiiink proper to urge, upon the subject re
ferred loin the public prints. And as he oxpccW.d
that some gentleman of the party, at whoso in
stance tlie people had assembled, would bring for
ward some im-asuio for the consideration o( tin
meeting, he would giro way that a lull opportuni
ty might be afforded.
"dr. Harry having sat down, and no cue fiiend
lv to the Adiuinstraliun appearing to state tho oh
jeet ot the meeting, or to propose any* tiling to:
its consideration, lien. M’ t’alla rose and oHere*
<h«* l evolution? which will doubtless appear in yon
paper, lie supporter) them in a short but appro
:>i into speech, atid fully pi ovc*I bv the document!
to which ho re1’ rred, the propriety of adnp'iiq
, the resolutions he h*id OlJercd, au*I the iliipolicj
and folly of denouncing as traitors that poitiono
onr f< llow-riti/.eii.s to wliom we urn j>n strongly
united by social and commercial lies, and whose
patriotism had evinced itself in cvciy scene of pe
ril and of danger through which our country hat
passed.
Judge Hledsoe t*v*n rose ami delivered hi
, views in that strain of peculiar eloquence which
no one i.= able to pnurtray but himself. I am un
equal to the task. Suffice it to say .that he show
ed himself worthy of the reputation which ho In
j long since possessed*, as an orator, a paliiot auil
j statesman.
• Upon reading the last resolution, Mr. Harry
| arose am! said, that after the able views ol the
j iwo gentlemen, who had preceded him, it would
j seem unnecessary to detain tho meeting with anv
i further t euiart.*; especially ns ho opposing voice
1 "as heard. Hut he could no', reconcile it to his
J feelings to give, a silent vote upon the ln,t n-so
| lotion, which involved considerations delicate, im
j port.in', and deeply interesting to the peace and
harmony oftliu states. It seemed as though an
j •libit were making to distuibthc tranquility of the
j Union, by sounding the alarm w hen no real dun
i g -r was to he apprehended. .Such is the semi
j live anxiety of the present administration—such
• is tUilr iMjtiiidles: ambition to retain power_and
I such their extreme fear of losing it, that evciv
movement on the part of the opposition, appeared
'o |jt| them wi<!i tin* most dri.wlfnl apprcht u-ion-.
A public meeting of freemen, peaceably assembled
to deliberate u;-ou the important questions which
agitate the nation, appeared to them like reb.il
lion, and with a boldness without example,attempt
to rirrul.de and to lu. the belief, that the friends
ot .lack5on aim at the severance ol the Union!
J It seemed to lie the design of (lie friends of .Mr.
j Adams, indicated by their public acts in ibis
j Sut>* and eldwhere, to make war upon the feelings
. ami so sport with the lights of our lellow citi/.ens
mi the * on Uk It seeiii»*tl iu fit* a pari ot Ihrir pl.m,
to limit up every act ot violence which might ,fi..,.
play it ;eli in tin- south, and then to charge u home
i iqioii '•on. Jackson and .ill his lrieiids, as proviu"
on their part a settled pui|«si!, a fixed determin.”
tion, to resist the execution ot the laws and to se
ver the Union. In order to make the charge plau
sible, every art is practised, and every means used
which n desperate parly, reduced to the last ex
tremity, can possibly invent. An etfuri is made by
the friends of Mr. Adams, to identify thenisoives
witli the Tariff—claiming lobe its exclusive fiiends
— the only patrons ol American industry. Not sa
ti-fied with calling tluinselves the exclusive friends
of the Tariff, the friends of John Quincy Ad
ams claim the high honor of being the on
ly preservers of public tranquilly, the only
stead last supporters of the Union,'the last hope
to which the confederacy must look lor safe
ly, in times of dillieiilty and danger ! ! Jhit the ef
fort is unavailing. Jackson’s whole public life, ii
a history of patriotic devotion to hh country. In
war or peace, a Incut to whatever g ive it securi
ty, or advanced iu glory and power. His votes
boldly Riven, and Ins opinions freely and publicly
; expressed, provo bis- friendship to what is call.:!]
, the “American System.” He is supported by T.i
! riff states ami by many of its ablest and most efli
> cieut friends throughout the nation, Pennsylvania,
that great enlightened and jieacoful State, first pre
sented him as a candidate for the presidency, and
with a firmness that no artifice can shake, remains
steadfast to her first choice. Yes, this during .Mi
litar;/ Chieftain, icho delights in scenes of 'blood
uiul carnage, is presented to the American people,
by the peaceful followers of the immortal fVnn.
This powerful evidence iri lit? favor, is not sufficient
to satisfy his enemies. The friends of .Mr. Adams,
j are now attempting, for political purposes, to in
j flame the public mind, and with an audacity that
J marks the reckless course of Ins administration,
, ‘’barge treason upon the people of the South, and
; attempted to connect the cause of CJen. Jackson
j w ith that of disunion. The language of the rcsoln
j tinns we have adopted, express fully our sentiments
j of disapprobation to the intemperate conduct of
certain public meetings in different States, llut
we make no distinction between our brethren of
! the North and those of the South. Politically, we
j -in la in to them ihe same relation,.and fondly cher
; ish file spirit of union that hinds us together as one
! people. Hot us not encourage sectional distinc
| lions—let in not array agniimt one portion ol flie
i union lire local prejudices of ihe other—rafher lot
us attempt lo allay, than excite them. Such was
; (lie advice of ihe Father of his country, and Ids
, children should never depart from it. Hut if our
| sympathies at e to be called forth and our friend
j ships tested: if we are Called upon to rejoice in the
1 crusade against any portion of the union; to make
■ war upon nouth Carolina and Ueorgia, because of
l 'fic violence of a few citizens ami a few meetings
:n those States, whilst the good and the groat,
| the men in authority and the great body of the
people remain true; if tho-friends of Mr. Adam*,
| p.iv ing over in silence similar nets of violence in
, .vow i ngland and in Hie N orth, call upon us to
I ..ct—to denounce as traitors to their country any
portion of it, let us awaken the recollections of His
tory, and see where our generous sympathies bc
long.
" iii'n • . ;ne ow c '^jrcs.s n was proposed to redo
to Spain the right of navigating thu Miasi.ssiopl,
the Now England States voted for It, and the South
against it. Had the N. England policy prevailed,
the new sovereign Stales ir. the valley of the Mis
sissippi, Would perhaps have Locn colonies under
'.hr- dominion of some European potentate. The
! millions iu the West who now repose in the posses*
j mod of freedom,'might have be r:n the oppressed \ as

statesmen, with Mr. Adams at their head, were op
posed to the purchase of Louisiana, nnd to the ad

Look to ,th« history of the late war, and say what
w.t« Ihe spirit evinced by those States, at that ap

green in our memory. When the South was in

a funeral procession. Yes. and they do not dare
to publish the speech of Tiistram Burgess, that
malignant calumniator of Kentucky, iu which he
apologized to his constituents for having suppoi ted

the Bill to insure the re-election of Mr. Adauis—
when that was accomplished, the bill would he

Equestrian .Erosta'tion.—Tlus following is .Mr.
Charles Green’s account of his equestrian flight on
the 2D:h of July, and ascent tho next day from
lieckenham:
fjaii'paM six o clock on i uesday evening,
the atmosphere being peifectiy serene, l deter
mined at oucj to iitt.ich the pony to the apparatus,
and prepare for the ascent. For this purpose, the'
hoop of the platform on which ho was to take his
, stand was opened, and lie was led from his stable,
bm w as extremely annoyed by the pressure of the’
crowd, to escape from which Jin took his station
with apparent pleasure, and behaved rudely to
one or two strange gentlemen who were anxious
to arrange a portion id'his decorations that had be
come misplaced, and which i was obliged to ad
just ntysull. While lii3 fetlock joints were sere
r:r.g, and other arrangements made; ho was per
fectly cglm and repeatedly licked my hands The
saddle, was made lust to the hoop, to which also
were attached my grappling non, a bag o! beans,
and about ZoO lbs. ot baliast in eloven bags. Soon
after seven o’clock every thing being in readiness,
I ordered the Inst rope to be loosened, and v/e
ascended slowly and nearly perpendicularly, a
roidst the acclamations of the largest assemblage
ol spectators l ever saw congregated. At the
moment of liberation, n y companion made several
plunges backwards and forwards, and trembled vi
j olivtly, evidently alarmed at the shouts which 1
! could distinctly hear until 1 had passed the Thames,
if**, however, in a lew seconds regained his wont
ed serenity and became quite passive, eating some
I-Cans fi pm my hand, which by icn|,ing forward, i
cotiid easily give him, J now hung out my grap
ple to he prepared for a descent, and dismounted
to arrange some ballast; but finding that my
’ght on one side tluciv (fie platform of] its per
pendicular and confide rat Jy discomposed my litiic
companion, 1 resinned my seat, and, discharging n i
]iltl«* ballast, attained th'* elevation of about j mile
and a quarter. Hero we Were visited by a des
cent ol snow of the finest texture, which had fiom
the reflection of the ray ol tho suu liom above,
and the oblique rays born tho clouds beneath, ij10
appearance of a shower of silver dust. On des
cending a little, tliii snow appeared changed to
ir-in; but on a still further descent, neither i tin ndr
9tiow were to be felt or seen, a circumstance not
to me tinunjiil. During these gradations the lit?!-.
atiim.il appeared quite at home, and Imi-died Ids
hag ol beans. Having been in the air upwards of
lull an hour, I began to prepare for u den, cot; and
Umio being scatceiy a breath of air stirring, this
was, with very litib; trouble, and w uhoiit the sligl11

the clo* er, which he devoured with ovary appear
ance of a keen appetite, although he bad eaten
more than a pint of beau- wliile in the r.ir. My first
consideration was to pioctire a proper pe. cn to

para lively trilling, I determined on retaining liio
remainder during the night, and cither myself or
my non, whom I expected witli tlio car, to make
an ascent the following morning, with Air. Hem
ming, Professor of Chyiuistry. the gentleman who
recently ascended with me Irani Stratford, and
who, Iroin the extreme roughness of the weather,
iiad heeu ou that occjsiou, prevented from nuking
some anxiously-wished experiments. He was,
however, again doomed to disappointment; tor on
Wednesday morning the wiud blew a strong gale
troni the west, which continued nearly the day,
and which would, in a few minute-, have drifted
the machine to tlie Noiic. In the evening it be
came more calm, but the usual waste and conden
sation of the gas, the balloon having been inflated
ou Alonday night, did not allow sufficient ascend
ing power for two persons. Under these circum
stances, the villagers having been led to anticipate
an ascent, I entered (lie car alone about five o’g
r’oek, and ascended to the height of about a mile.
After remaining up nearly halt an hour, 1 descend
ed Safely on Ihotulcy common, five iiiilusJrom the
field from which I ascended. The balloon, car,
&c. were then packed up and sent off to London;
but my travelling companion, who had during tlio
day been visited by some hundreds of individuals,
did not arrive until last evening, when he resum
ed his old quarters safe and sound, being the first
of his race that (the wooden horse of Pacolct ex
c«pted)_ever_traversed the regions of the air.”
