against the treaty, but against it, authors, and their rr.o

statesmen who should continue to favor it Mr. Adams,
the negotiator and the o?tcr>ible author of the trratv,
was the statesman agamst whom all m> censure w.as.di
rected, and I was certainly sincere .n my then belief of
his great culpability but the declaration which he has]
latelv made on the floor of the House of Representatives. I
absolves him from all censure on account of that treaty,
and places the blame on the majority of Mr. Monroe s
cabinet, by whose votes he wa? governed contrary to hi. ,
own opinions in establishing the boundary which 1 so
much condemned. ... .
The v.uce of a mere individual, not in any public
?tat.on, and a thousand unles iroin tt.e *eat of Govern
ment. wa- no impedimeni to the progress of the treaty,
it went forward -wee turned in the month of tebrua
rv 1819 - approved by Mr Monroe's Cabinet?unani
mAusly ratified by the Sena'e-and greeted with the
universal api-lanse of the public press
But all this concurrence of authorities arid ot ap
plaud made no impression upon me 1 continued to
look upon th- treaty with ind ^ti-m and amaz-men' ;
and the more so. because the publ-shed correspondence
showed, that the sacrifice of our territory was aratui
tou? and wan<on! that the Spanish Government had
off red us more than we hid accepted ! tha' w had vo
luntarily sacrificed our rivers, bocndar.es and territory!
and I continued to assa.l the treaty under the confident
belief that such an unnalural boundary could n?t
stand, and tha. the sacrificed territory would eventual
ly be restored to the country from which it had been
torn
The Treaty of 1819, between the Un'ted States and
Spain so far ns it applied to the S?uih-wes>ern B?un- j
dary of the Un-t-d S.atn-, ?? one ?f the nmst gra

plished tog- ther. 1 could not acn-e to it Mexco and
Texas were at war? nnd to admit Texas into our
Union was to go to war with M-xico, with the laith ol
treaties and the opinion of the world ngamst us. J
could not go for adims* on: recog ition wis the furthest
? hat I could venture; nnd that, wi h some insgtving,
?t s"> esrlv a singe ot the contest, for f-ar of the effect
it might have on our c inineroe with M-xico
The ? ext year, (1837 ) being the first of Mr. Van Btt
ren'fi administrati it. a Ttxian minister (General Mcmu
cari Hunt) arrived licie to solicit the admission of his
country into our l*n on. lie did me the honor to speak
to nie on the subject, counting largely upon my co ope
ration, from'lie well-know detestation which I had ex
pressed for the treaty wh eh gave Texas away. But I
t"ld him from the beginning that it tvns impossible; that,
much a< I desired the restoration nf Texas, first du
ties were to mv own country ; that Mexico and Texas
being at war I could not jeo| ard Ihe pcaee of the United
'tales, compromise its honor in the eyes of nations, and
injiiie its con merce. by taking a step which should give
Mexico a rinht to treat us us an enemy. Mr. Van Bu
ren's administration gave the same answer; and all Ame
rica appr-'ved it.
Thus, wh I- being incompatibly the first opponent
to the loss ot Texas, and the fir?t advocate of ita re
eovery, I have yet already twice found it impo'sii-l* t<

Such has been my conduct, and the reasons for it,
on the two occasintip, wlipn the admission of Texas
imo our Union has bpen proposed, and when I have
oap-vid b th propn-ittons Now, n third proposit 01
to* admission is made, a*d under circum ?tances tnor
' irnial :.nd 'mpoying than heretotore ? it conies in 'lie
'ortnof U Treaty, iaid before the Sr-nate?and what I
s 'Sit do upon this 1 reaty doea not become me to say,
s anding 8s I do in on officul relation to the question,
? and bound soon to act upon it. All tb?t I shall say ,9,
that I wish iho discussions oo the question of ratifying
I this Treaty t-> t?e public ?that the nature of the ques
t?.n-the manner in which it 1hh been conducted here
(,.t..re_j-?tic? '? t!i?* people?justice to individual Se
nntois ?the absurdity of a secret discussion in the Se
rum- and a public discussion m the newspapers?the
indisputable fact, thai jobbers, speculators, and intri
guer*, have known all along wlm wa? concealed irom
the pe-pleand ilieir representatives-all these circum
stances. and the prevention of future false reports ? ??
the action of the Senate for smsfter purposes, (politi
cs!, speculating. and st ck-jobbing,) require ihe action
.if the Senate to the publie; and I shall accordingly
move to open iisd-ors upon the discussion of the treaty,
when it shall be taken up.
Leaving out ot view, then, the treaty which is now
before the Senate, and only looking to the general
question, I can say, that 1 look to the recovery ol Tex
as, and ot our mutilated rivers and natural bounds
ries, as inevitable lads in the natural urder ol human
events; that they natuia lv belong to the valley of the
Mississippi, and to til- American Union, and will rr
turn to 't with ease and honor, if wise nnd temperate
counsels prevail; and tha' this untom] consummation
of a c< ming event can only he delayed f .r a time by
throwing the quest on inio our elections, perverting
it ro:n it* national buns, making it sectional and par
? zan, prostituting il to unworthy piirpos?s, running the
qiiestirn at in-n, and making h the mentis ofdiS'Utb

si which I >t"Od "srlitary and alone" twenty.five
years ago : bu- it is not so. | am too old for that pile
nitty, and too much a friend to popular Government
to njoice in anything which is discreditable to it. A
t.eling of mortification, rather, oppresses me at the in
eons t-nry urd incoiis.derhfness which I have wit
?i? s d When T. xns wan ouis, free from debt aid
full of land, and m-ght have been reia-ned without
a que,t.on fmm abroad, w.thou' dissension at h-me
and without theexp-nse of a shilling-when tb-s was'
the case, we threw the virgin province, no a worthless
toy awav ! Now, when eviscerated of h-r lands, and
'oaded w th debt-when her recovery is attended with
the daneer of f..reign war, the certainly of domestic
dismn-ent, the 1?8S (,f commerce, and the disturbance
of business ?when this is the case, we are all of a sud
d-n fe z- ?1 with a blind and furiou* passion to repossess
her. Immediate annexation is t*e word ! nnd we can i
not even wan one brief year fur the ripened Pear to fall I
of itself mtoour hands This >s inconsistent and d'scre-'
ditabl-, and implies levity and folly, instead of ju'dg
inent nnd patriotism, in the rondirt of our public af-|
'airs Remg n friend in popular Government, and anx
ious for us honor and surras, I rogrri ns much to see
the sudden passt-.n of H44, ns | did to see the slug
g.sh apathy ? f 181!) I wish to se? R .man steadine*.
aid not Atheninn leyitv, prevail in our Government;
am' being myself a man of some temperance and stab'
l"y, addicted to no paroxysm*, and suhj ct to no va
riations I shall continue to advocate the recovery of
our sacrifiet territory, nnd mutilated r-vers, and nat-i
ml boonda ies, in the same calm and considerate man
ner ?s for twenty-five years past.
W.tn resp. ct to Texas, Her destiny is fixed Of
course, I, who consider what 1 am about, always speak
o? lexas a- cens imted at the time of the treaty -f
i-l'.i, and not as consuiut d ny the R-puhl-c of Te'xis
Coi"jireh> ndinj? the rap. , 1, and r0f,y tnwns and v.Ha-1
fTPR of .New Mexico ! now and alwy* as fullv under
Ihe dominion ol the Republic of Mexico, as Q .eher
and all the towns nnd vili.ig. ? ol Cnnidu are ui d^r!
fie dominion of Great Br.'am! It is of this Texas
the old Spanish Texis?of which I always spraU; and
ot her, I say. her desimy is fixen! Whatever may he
rnl? of tbe presen, movement, her d-s .nation is to
return to her natural p-sition?'hit of a part of the
American Union The mtrrrst o< both partis requires
antJ ,I|P eame fe. ling and pol.cv which rnsd- the
X'an people desire it tnr eight years past, will r,,al?e
ih-m con'mue to de?ire t uni'l the re union ts acco.o
nlisheil. No earthly power, except Mexico, has a Pglit
to interfere in this question; and her right must ao"n
cease. |t she is wise, she will cease hostilities at
"lice, scknowledge your independence, and rejoice t<>
see you return to the American Union. If she is not
wise, she may keep up a constructive war for some
yearn, without muk-ng anything by it; for nominsl
war, alter the expiration of the present armistice, will
? nswrr no purpose. Sps'n refus* d to acknowledge
the intl pendenre of Hol'and for spventy years after
she was actually independent ; that exhib'tmn of Cas
iill an pride nod ??b>lntacy m:ide no d ffV-rence in the
figh's of Holland, and in the conduct of Hurnpe ?
From the time iliat actual war eea??d, U Hind wss ad
until tl bv Europe to all the rijjhts of ari independent
power, without rr.ija d to the nominal pretensions of
Sp'im; nnd eo it wns w t*i the lat- Suanish Provinces
in tiie New world ; and so it will be with Texas snd
Me* co. A short time, and either the acknowledgment
ot M xico, or the consent ol all natn-ns, will give Tex
as all the rights of a sovereign power: the question of
admission will th?n be one " f exclusive arrangement
between the two countries; for no .anhly power, ex
cepi M> X'Ci>, ha* a light to interfere in this question;
and, hi tact, 1 know of no one that wiaheg to interfere
in it
If kept Irec from sectional views, partisan politics,
and selfish, personal and sordid schemes, the reunion
may then bo easily effected, and in a way Hut nu^ht to
he satisfactory to the whole Union, though nut without
a heavy expense to the federal treasury, i onie when it
may the cost of recovering (hit disniemberid limb of
Louisiana may eqiJ:1|. or exceed, the whole co?l of the
original acquis turn of that vast . rovince ! such is the
fruit of the unaccountable trcau of 1819! liultlie cost
i? money will he no ob>t icle to "my action, t'osts of a
different kind are what I wish to avoid: costs in national
honor in foreign war - in ruined commerce? in domes
tic dissension m sectional animosities ai d in the dis
turbance ot the t>armon\ of the Union and the business
ot the people I he sacrifice of Texas was a c >1 mitnus
blunder in l-Sl'l: let us not repeat the blunder, and i!ou

won't talk wnh a d?d fool!" A shade of anger passed
over the com V-nance of the form?r; bat he was a man
