pand-d, by atirh a scene?—Still, my brethren,
experience and observation teach us. that there 1
is something in the performance of religious
ties which the most hardened infidel can not
witness, without emotion. Suppose, however,
that the charge he tiue it roust be sustamad

• I most equally diaiinguishe.il on the rolls of
fame, who have assembled in lodges, and in.'ul j
ged in folly, at the risk of exciting the scoffs j
nd sneers of an inquiring and censorious
world. Every brother, however, knows per
fectly well, that there is not a single point or
sec"et in masonry, which does not illustrate i
s ime valuaole truHi, or recoir.tneifd some trior
al or religious principle. I be very furniture
of txir lodge, ihe garb we wear, p’aiidy inti,
■nates that <he object of cur researches is the
glory of God and the end of all our illuMia
'■ons, happiness in a future world, the lamb
skin white apron, of late the subject of so
much ridicule, ‘'reminds us of that purity ot
life and conduct So essentially necessary to
our gaming ail mission into that celestial lodge
above, where the Supreme Architect of the
Universe presides.'* The square lesehes us
to square our actions by the rule of virtue;;
*ncl the compass to circumscribe our desire* !
and keep our pasviona in due bounds with til
mankind; the plummet admonishes us to walk
uprightly in our several stations, before God
;tnd man; and the level reminds us that we are
travelling on the level of time, to
' bat undiscovered country, from whose boQrn
No traveller returns:
while the blaimg star, emblematirk of the Star
ut Hnh eliem, which directed ibe wise men of
lie east to the spot where our Saviour wss
*>orn, is intended as a guide to our foota'ep* on
our journey through Ide, till we shall have
passed the Jordan of death, and landed on the
shores of a blissful immortality, where the
wicked cease from troubling and the weary are
at rest. I need no’, howeve , any brethren,
multiply instai ces of this nature, as the time
which I had prescribe d to myself it wasting
rapidly away, and I ntus. hasten to the consid
eration of more important charges.
It is said that masonick principles are at
war with morality and religion, and danger
ous to the liberties uf our country. Ibis, my
brethren, if true, ta an important charge, and
deserves the consideration of every ehristiau
•id of every patriot- Before, however, sen
ic-nce otcondemnation •« pronounced upon to
• •any distinguished worthies of other t.mey;
before the whole tnasonick fraternity are bran*
ded as traitois to then country, and as enemies
to its religion and its laws, will it not be well
to pause for a moment, and endeavour, if pos
sible, to ascertain what their principles are. I
know of none other than what are contained in
tie different masonick charges and lectures,
t’errml me, then, to introduce on this tecs
ion, an eairaet from the chaigc delivered to
hi entered apprentice on bis initiation to the
first degree. ‘ I here are three great duties
• Inch as a mason you are charged to inculcate,
• o God, to your neighbour, and to yourself—
.«» God, in never mentioning his name but
with that reverential awe, which is due from
‘tie creature to his Creator, to implore his aid
•i all lawful undertakings, and to esteem him
•• yeur chief good,—to your neighbour, in
•cting upon the square, and doing unto him
•a you wish he should do unto you,—and to
yourself, in avoiding all irregularity and intern
oeranse which may impair your facultit* and
lebase the dignity of your profession. In the
late you are to be n quiet and peaeeable sub
leet; t*ue to your government and just to your
country you am out to eouiilenutco disloyalty
I
or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal au
ihority, and conform with cheerfulness to she
government ut which you live.* Such are the
principles taught in ma<ooick lodge*, k I tie
ty the eorld t0 prove, in a single instance,
that the reverse are taught.
It is asid, however that masons sre bound to
punish even with death, thvsa who violate
their seciets—'bat ihey *re bound to sustain
each other m law suit*, and to support a bro
ther in preference to any other, for office.
Before implicit credit is given to till* slander
ous tale, it may perhsps be well to pursue and
inquire leom whence it originate*.
fite depravity or folly of a ftw misguided
men, has lately bioi , lit the masonick Iraicrni
ty m»o scandal anil di-grate. A number of
brethren, who connected themselves with the
institution when it was'mtfie full tide of sue
ceaslul experiment,* snd could discover noth*
ing in it wrong so |*ng as it was popular, with*
out r« fl: cling thit, like the purgation of a pre
ct'-us metal, it h*» risen front each successive
ordral wuh renewed claims to admiration from
•f* sugmented brdl »ncy and worth, ha*e te
cendy witiidiswn; and nut biing content with
having done so, hate of late become its most
bi ter persecutors. Charily to *11 m; nkmd m a
part of'he masonick erred; it doe* not ihero
fore become us, and especially on this occa
sion, to censure or condemn. The world will
(1o them justice—tbeir motives will shortly be
developed—-and the seal of approbation, or ol
infamy, will ere long be stamped upon each of
their forehead. If their mottvrs be pure, they
will b-regarded as patrio's—if events shall
hereafter bring their motive* into jeopardy,
and it shvl1 fin'lly appear 'hat tn» rcenary ob
j*cts induced tin tn in the first plate to solicit
admission, whir I. object not having been at
tainerl, have led them at last to prove recreant
to a cause which they had espoused lor year*,
and whose principle*have uniformly been the
aame, then ihoy w II be rrga.dt d by an im
partial world as irailoia to their trust
The deciples of our blessed Lord *Hh*i d to
hi* cause, so long as the miracles which he
wrought gatheitd an admiring multitude a
round him; but, no sooner d d that multitude
cease to lis tn wnli rapture to the horned sc
cents which flowed from hi hp», and aimed:
m-B pursued him into the Mount of Olives, to 1
arrest snd bring him before the chef prttsts j
and eiders, then those very disc.pits d r-ook I
him snd fled.* Peter, being a fide b- ldtr, or
having perhaps a little more curiosity than the
re*t, followed him afar off. As si on, however
a* he found hi* l^ord snd Mas er in disgrace, j
be promptly denied all knowledge of his Sa- ]
vi> ur. And on being charged a second time j
with having been with Jt*us of Nazsreil, lie j
deoied it with an oath; and on being cli* ged a i
thi'd time he began to curse and swear, ».ty- '
ing. I know not the m»n. Thus you perceive,
how natural it is, even for the best of men, to
desert their (rend* in the hour of psnl:
The roan whom royal eyes disown.
When was his form to courtiers known.
Whether the charges alluded to have orl^i.
nsted with rent am mason* nr not, is of btile
or O ) i -portauce. Every meson, ami eveiy
man who will lakethe trouble to inquiie with
a view to ascertain the troth, nuisi be convinc
ed ofthair falsehood. Who ever tieard of a
lodge si'ling in judgmeul on guilty offenders,
and imposing any other penalty than that of
rvpuisiun?—If soy, when nr where? The most
inveterate adver»aries of our orch r do not, I
belisve, pretend it. Hut it is stid that masons
are bound to sustain each o'hyr in taw suits —
The experience of the whole world trium.
phantiy refute* the charge, and amid ill ths
slander-, which have bsen uttered, not a tingle (
ease has been adduced which affords the slight- j
est presumption of it* truth. And iasly, u is J
said that a mason is bound by os*h to vote for s
brother in preference to a stranger, wheie he
is s candidate far office. The masons, by as
*orj*tmg with each other in lodges, snd by j
thus srquinng a knowledge of each other's
charac er, have ir. particular cases, been induc
ed to give each other a preference, is not im
probable. The same thing occurs, day after
day, among members of the same church;
but that mason* are bound by oa'b to support
each other, is as fal*e as the Alcoran The
only evidence, 1 believe, in support of this
chsrge, ts a pretended obligation rectrtl) pub
lished on the authority of tome recreant breth
ren in a neighbouring village, unci which bas
lately, for »b« first tune, met my ear. 1 he au
thors of this publication have seen proper it em
selves to insert ii in a note. The experience
of sgra concur in pronouncing it a ralumry,
for masons have always been found in opposing
ranks in the field of politicks, arid of war, and
the brother who should inqu'rts whether the
cancidate whose cause he espoused w*» a ma
son or not, would be violating as w ell hi* duty
to the msHomck institution, as to the country
which cbeiished Inni witliin her besom. It n
unquestionably true, thst individual mason*
have at times permitted convidersticn* like
these, to influent* their conduct. 1 heir exam
ples, I trus', wdl never be imitated by men
who regard ibeir duty, tbeir consciences, or
tbeir oaihs.
An auempT, my nretnrsn, nas often Been
made to compare tbe .Vlssomek societies with
those of the Illuminati m German) 8c France,
winch paved the way for that revolution winch
alttrwarda deluged Fuiopu in blond. An at
tempt bus also been made to extract from the
farewell address ot the immortal Washing'or,
a caution to beware of ill* institution over
whiah he had presided for years, and w hich be
nevef cessed to cherish, even on his dying
pillow. The attempts, however, in both eases,
have proved so entirely abortive, and been so
triumphantly refuted, that any efforts of mine
to refute them spam, would be like burning
tapers at noon day to assist the sun iu enlighten*
mg the world.
The conclusion, therefore, my brethren,
seams to be irrestst.hie, that the mstitutu n it
self is well enough. The period allotted by
common consent to its eaistence, and the ehar*
aeterof its illustrious members through a long
succession of ages, at ence repel the idea of
corruption at the fountain. It Is, however, j
admitted and that toe, without hesitation, be- |
cause such ia the faot, that many unworthy !
members have found admissioo within its
walls.
Koftuntely, however, for the institution, as
their seifish purposes could not be gratified by
continuing as members, a number have recent
ly withdrawn and sought their gratification by
aid of its enemies, who have, thus far, receiv
ed them with open arms. As the chaff driven
before a rrhgbty wind, after buttering a mo
mem m the air, descends to the ground at last
•ad 4 »«wu ao morcj so when the gale which

will sink into sumo unfreqnsn'rd slough. and

their course;but, at last.having neuh.r worth
«r character to sustain them, they wnl descend !
from iheit faneud elevation, 10 their proper!
level; and as the descending body S'qiurea j

through which it fails, will eventually sink

may be so— but the very best way of
effectually overthrowing public and
private enmities is, by persevering io a

The plan may be alow in its opera
tions, but it is, nevertheless, certain;
the bread thrown upon the waters will
b« gathered after many days.
