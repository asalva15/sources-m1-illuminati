TO lIEADERS a:jd correspondents.
" Seneca" is received. The stile is pure
and the sentiments are iplerefting. We
will him an honorable place. But we
fear that Seneca's Morals will never, corieft
the onjeft of his reproof, nor tame the po
pulate of Pennsylvania.
Cur fair friend, who dates from the Syl
van retreats of New Jersey, is requ-fled to
perfevrre in the talk of writing. The efFu
lions of an enlightened and correft mind will
always be greeted by the Editor. Solitude
is one of the parents of poesy and the mag
nificence and varied beauty ot the " rural
reign,' 1 at this enchanted season, are favora
ble to studious pursuits and " musing medi
tation.
The Song, in the Yankee stile, from B >l
- in praise of Mr. Jeflerf >n and Nantz,
will raise a laugh at the expence of demo
cracy. For an Impromptu, it is entitled
to commendation, a few metrical errors ex
cepted, which are venial in our lenient courts
ot Criticism. where it perceives that the of
fenders is not an old one. Of this sarcastic
ballad, the last stanza is as ludicrous as the
song: of Liago.
«• A Friend to the Gazettb," is
egregioufly mistaken if he supposes felling
single papei» an advantage to the Editor—
it has proved a serious enience and in
jury, and the determi ation not to fell any
(hall be adhered to.

At * highly rcfpeftable Literary Club in
"England, the virtues and achievements, the
probity and intrepidity of Wajbinvlon were
the fubjeft ot convcrfation. After a long
and merited eulogium on our late President,
a gentleman asked the honourable Edmund
Burke, who had graced the eulogium of
Walhington with his peculiar energy, whe
ther, in justly kftimatir.g the chara&er of
Walhington, some allowance not to
be made for the energy of the panegyrist ;
and whether Mr. Burke supposed binfeff
there ever exilted so exalted a «hara£er, as
he had contributed to define. I forgive
you, replied Edmund Burke n for I myfelf
never believed that a man of the exalted dig
n:ty and.intrepidity if George Wafliington
could pofiiH'v txift, until I pe.rfonall) con

On Saturday last, ttie Supreme Court of
the United States commenced i's fe.i.on, in
this city. The indifpofitioti of Judge Chafe
prevented the Court from proceeding tobu
lintfs on the firft day of the Term, Sev
eral important cauf< s will be heard and'de
termined in the cou fe of the prefen't week.
The cause which the Court has now before
it. is tha' of Taloot againll Seaman ; in
which property to the amount of nearly one
hundred thousand dollars is in queflion
Judtje Cuihiug (owing to indisposition)
has not attended.
An Indian has been tried before tjie Fe
deral Court at Knoxville, for the rnurtler of
James Johnftaii. He confefLJ the faft ;
the Juiy found him guilty; and he was ex
ecuted. The Indians are extremely anxious
t«> bring to justice another Indian called
Little Rabbit, concerned in the above mur
der.
A private in the artilletid, on Governor's
Id . v', N. Y. has had his arm amputated,
in consequence of an explofion of
a cartridge remaining in a gun, which flut

From the 3d to the 10th of August; in
clusive, there were 61 deaths in the city of N.
York, of whom there were 49 children, 8
men and 4 women.—None of the yellow
fever.
It appears by accounts from Savannah, and
by a letter from Col. Hawking to Governor
J.ickfon, that the Governor of Florida, Col.
Don Vincent Folch, fitted out an expedition
against Fort St. Marks, then in pofleflion of
the aijyenturer Bowles. On the approach
of the veflels and troops, Bowles and his ad
herents fled, and the fort was taken pofleflion
of. The officers who surrendered that place
to Bowles, are to be tried by a Court Mar
tial.
The Democrats fay that a man who
marched at the bead and adted as a guide,
to the British, when they entered the town
of Petersburg, deserves to be banned bj eve
ry law human and divine—We could draw
a comparison,—but Tench Coxe fays com
parisons are odious ! •
Tench C6xe thinks a law partakes .very
little of divinity which would tuck him up
a la lantern ! .'
The fafhionable cant of the Jacobin poli
ticians, deists, St illuminati of the day, is the
efficacy of frit principles, and the innumer
able truths which can be educed from
them, favorable to the rights of degraded
men, aod insulted reason. It is observable
that the metaphyfic wranglers,,v *.O talk thus
much of principles, have very little princi
ple themselves ; and after the molt inflated
harranguei, in favor of benevolence, to the
people, conclude their Oratory by (Yealing
watches and spoons and wives and daughters.
A J icobin Zealot, in an acrim niotn and
lying eflay, written with the intention to in
jure Gen. Hamilton, having quoted the
authori-.y of General Knox in l'upport of the
calumny, it immediately produced the fol
lowing note from that gentleman to the
editors of the Boston Chronicle.
Messrs. Adams isf Rb>ades,~Having
had a sentence of an address to Gen. Ham
ilton printed in your paper of Monday,
pointed out to me, in which it is aflertedt
that " he (alluding to the fubferiber) pof
feflcs Walhingtoiv's evidence of your un.
manly arts to degrade him." Truth dic
tates, that I Ihould fay, I posskss no such
EVIDENCE. H.KNOX.
Boston, Aug. 4, 1800.
Though the Chronicle printers have print
ed the above in a very small chara&er, yet
it is proprr to insert it very conspicuously
in the Gazette of the United Stares. It
will furnilh another official detedion of
Jacobinical fallliood.
The Aurora of this morning ccnUtiis the

The London Morning Chronicle of 25th
June has the following remarkable para
graph—
" We have freti accounts from America
of a late date. Mr. Pickering, thss S;-cieta-
ry of State, we are informed, has fceei
moved. Mr. Pickering was r.:uch atta
