Hampshire, of mnking, v<ing and vending to others Platt'a
Patent Portable Gyist Mill, wonld respectfully inform the
| public that he is now prepared to sel! the ahove Mills, with |
rlﬁhta fur towns not disposed of. The peculiarities of this
- Mill, which render it superior to any now in use, consist in
the simple manner of adjusting the runner, it being suy
- pended by mreans of a hollow screw at the upper end of the |
spindle, by which any pressure can be produced, thereby |
superceding the necessity of driving «o heavy a stone as
, those of the old fa<hioned mill; and being hut 24 foet in |
diameter, the work is done much nearer the centre, and re
! quires but ahout two-thicds the power used by the common |
mill to do the same amonnt of work ; and considering the |
cost of the Milly, which is %125, with French burr stone, the
saving of power, the convenience in tending and keeping
in order and its c‘umlulu; y 1L is acknowledged to be by far |
the most improved Mill in use, !
Some 50 of the above Mills have been sold by the sub

Du. A, H Cumiariv-~Dear Sir: You wish to know of
me what has been the result in my own case, of the appli
cation of THE GALVANIC BELT AND NECKLACE.
My reply is as follows :
For about twenty yenrs 1 had been suflering from Dys.
pepaia. Kvery yeur the symptoms became worse, nor
could I obtain permanent reliet from any course of med.
<al treatment whatever. Abont fourieen years since,
<consequence of frequent exposure to the weather o the
discharge of my t.ntmd duties, | became sub cct to a
severe Chronie Rhienmatism, which for jear alter year,
vaused me indescribable anguish. Farther: in the winter
of 45 and 46, 10 consequence of preaching a greast deal
i my own and various other churches in this regios, |
was attacked by the Bronchitis, which soon became so
severe as to requiie an immediate suspension of my pas
toral labors. My nevvous system was now thoroughly pros
2rated, and as my Brovelutis became woise, so abio did my
D)lp.rsu and Rbeumatic atfection- thus evineing that
these disorders were connected with each other through
the medium of the Nervous System. In the whole phar
macopwia there scemed to be no remedml agent which
mnld‘ reach aud rocnrrue wmy Nervous System ; every
!hms that I had tried for this purpose had completely
failed. Atlast ) was led by my friends to examine your
inventions, and (though with no very sanguine hopes of
their eMciency,) | determined to try the effect of the
application of the GALVANIC BLLT AND NECKLACE,
with the MAGNETIC FLUID. This was in June, 1546,
