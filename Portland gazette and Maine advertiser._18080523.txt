So long as this country is held up as

by an administration who has evinced
| [ such uncommon zeal to admit them to
the rights of citizenship, for the obvi
ous purpose of increasing its suppoit
trs—there never will be wanting fugi
tives from justice to avail themselves of
the4 asylum ;H where (by Jive years rc
mience) they not only become great
patriots and inclined to infuse their
ideas of govermm ;it among us, but fre
quently collect in mobs and enforce it
by the powers of sbalala. Hence we

Tne following paragraph from a Lon

Mi. I souls wrre landed trotii Ireland
by the Philadelphia ships alone : and
supposing the number conveyed by
ships to all the other harbours of A
meric • equal only to that ot the Phila
i deiphia ships, the yearly transport will
amount to near 30,000 souls ! No slave
ship was ever so crowded as the Amer
ican ships with passengers from Lon
j idoflderry. We have heard a ship of
' 1215 ions took on board 530 passengers,
'which with twelve of the crew, make a
1 total of 542, being double the number
