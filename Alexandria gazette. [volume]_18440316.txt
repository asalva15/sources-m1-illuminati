MISCELLANEOUS.
LOUD BROUGHAM, in private life, does
not bear the slightest resemblance to the same
noble personage in public. Henry Brougham,
as counsel, pleased his client; as member of Par
liament, he pleased his party; as Lord Chancel
lor, lie pleased no one—plaintiffs, defendants, or
their counsel; as a Peer, he has frightened all
parties; but in his private life, from young to old,
from grave to gay, there is but one feeling with
regard to him. He is the delightful, the talent
ed, the kind,the instructive, and the beloved of
all. Those he has made his enemies, relinquish
their resentment under the magic influence of his
social powers, and wonder whether they have I
i not mistaken the meaning of the kind-hearted!
being who has enchanted them with his wit and
humor. On Lord Brougham's entrance into the
drawing-room of his friends, he meets the in
mates with boisterous cordiality which continues t
until he has shaker, hands with all. Should the-e
be children, they immediately run to him with
extravagant joy—contending with each other,
who shall be first to receive his notice. Nothing
can exceed tli» tact with with this extraordinary i
man accommodates himself to the tastes and abiL
iiies of all whom he knows, and the apparent,1
and perhaps real interest he feels in the subject
of their discourse for the time. For the chil
dren he has some tale that produces shouts of
laughter, but always leaves a moral engraved
upon the memory. For those who have no
one pursuit from which his Lordship can clean
or confirm a fact in the arts or sciences, he has 1
anecdotes, narrated with such tact and rruisem
blancc, that they leave on the mind of the hearer
an impression of his having witnessed the s«*ene ;
related. There is nothing too minute for his ob
servation; and should he be doomed to spend a
half hour with one ofihe fair sex, who unfor
tunately has no idea beyond the fashionable
costume of the day, he, to the wonder of all, can
talk as technically on the point as if he were j
himself a lady. One great contradiction be-;
tween the noble Lord’s public and private senti- ' j
ments is, the different estimation he places upon
the feelings of mankind in private and public life;
in the former he net only avoids all prejudicial
observations upon another, but he would sternly
repress an indication of such a desire in others; 1
whilst his recklessness of the feelings of an an- .
tagonist in the latter is notorious.—A* Y. Repub.
LITERARY CURIOSITY.—The following

PUNCH’S LETTER.—Punch’s letter on the
ipproaching holidays is probably in therecoliec- |
.ion of ourreaders. His brother Toby writes M
much in the same vein :
“Tickle'4'of-hali. Academy, Deo. 10, 1813. I
“Afy Dear Father: The near approach of the
Christmas vacation affords me the pleasurable
opportunity of addressing you on the sub ject of 1 1
my studies, in which I trust you will find me > <
greatly improved. On French days 1 regularly j
iJine on six dozen oysters, that l may acquire the ! ■
language like a native, and already 1 find no (lit- !
ti.ruity in getting through a lot of Shelley’s works, |
which 1 quite devour, and readily translate into
another tongue. Creek we learn by candle lijst
as our proiossor thinks it is the easiest me'hcd ol
becoming acquainted with (»recce, hut, alter all,
this is a point much questioned by some of the , '
illuminati. Next half-}ear I am to commence !
Spanish; in the mean while, I am undergoing a
preparatory course of onions arid che-nuts. I
have not >et touched Italian, fearing to have too I
many irons in the fire at once. I have almost ;
forgot my Latin, which you wilt be glad to learn
1 prosecute with the utmost rigor. After
that English comes quite easy and natural, i
fpr we stand in a class to answer questions ri la- ;
tive to parts of speech, and syntax, (Mr. ;
Tickletop savs the income tax is a sin-tax ) and •
all that sort of tiling: what we Know we toil, j 1
and what we don’t we miss, and that is called j
parsing! As for exercises, on Saturdays some
of the°boys learn to dance, which lam anxious
to do, only l have filled a hook with eyes, mouths,
ears, and noses, so you will perceive that draw
ing has been a principal feature; hut l hop*' soon
to make laces, which will he delightful, although 1
I must not paint myself in too flattering colors, i
Geography has not been neglected. I am us
familiar with both globes as the gold and silver
fish in the parlor, only l have not done any maps s
vet as Mr. T. thinks maps will lead to chart-ism, (
which is to be avoided. Ancient history 1 find
vastly entertaining, especially that portion about -
Romulus and Remus being suckle ! by a wod,
which reminded rne of a like instance in moie
modern times: I mean Little Red Ridmg-lK-.n ^

The experiments in elec tricity were so truly ,
shocking that I preferred attending the hy

it is a singular coincidence that ad the d<<) s
