It is claimed bj our traducers “that we hate a
capability to be brought in our influences as an
institution in contact with the interests of one or
the other of the political parties, at the will of the
institution a* expressed hy the general head of the j
Order, or that in like manaer to favor the interests
of Christians in a particular denomination, or infi
delity.•’ To this we reply, that it is impossible in
the very nature of things, is I shall proceed to show.
It is impossible, beeati-e first, in our institution *11
parlies both political are! religious are represented.
We have wings, democrats, tree soilers, native
Americans, northern men, and southern men. We
have ftedbyterians. Baptists, Methodists. Episcopa
lians. Atmtmle Hrformrtf, Reformers, Quakers,
l niversalists, and in tact, all denominations arc
represented. Now, I ssk, how eoiiU the influence
of this vast brotherhood be brought in contact with
the interest of any one denomination, or political
party, without producing an immediate disrupture. j
“ for ,f * b«u<e be divided against itself it must fall?” !
There i> no way in which the most ethereal imagi
aation could conceive of the production of results i
*o irieligioui and unpatriotic as are intimated in the i
abogg charge, without the presumption of dishonesty
and corruption, upon the part of our beloved Order,
which insinuation we repel, and rast bark with
characteristic leal, produced by a con-eiousness of
Innocence.
We say it it Impossible lor the Independent Order
of Odd Fellows to be a society of the capability
ascribed to it in the above charge, because second,
history proves that a society having such a*‘capsbil.
itv " COUM nni be otherwise than -rif-deitturii«r.
We have an instance of this in European history.
Illuminati was the name of a secret society which
was founded on the first of May, 177H, by Adam
Wesahaopf, Professor of Carior. f,aw in the Univer
sity oflngotdstadt. The avowed object of Ibis Older ,
was to diffuse from secret societies, as from so many
centres, the light of science over the world; to pro
pagate the purest pnnripies ol virtue, and to rein- I
•late mankind in the happiness w hich they enjoyed '
during the golden age fabled by the poets. Prof.
Robison and Abbe Raircsi assure ns that the" real j
ohject * of this society wet by •• clandestine arts to j
overturn every government, and every religion; to
bring the seienre of civil life into contempt; *nd to !
reduce mankind to that imaginary elate of nature
where they lived independent of each other on the
spontaneous production of the earth." Whether
the above be justice to the •• Illuminati " or not, I
will not now say. Some historian* discredit the
account ol Prof Robinson; others give it full force
and effect. Whether the charge be true or false,
Weistisupt amt his coadjutors had not character
sufficient, did not possess enough of public confi
dence to secure his institution from ju«* suspicious
Ot the impious and rebellious character ol his designs.
This society was power .bed and abolished by law
in I7RS, by the elector of Bavaria. Tt is item ot
hislsry demonstrates that a society of the character
ascribed to Odd Fellow*, in the .shore charge,could
got exist J
This society of Weishaupt, being convicted ofthe
capability of interfering with the interests ot chns
tMIlty or political pari nans on, could not exist. It
cannot be said th»t the suppression ot the" Illumi
nati’1 was the result of a wise opposition to alt
secret associations, lor there never was a time when
Free Masonry was enjoying a higher reputation, or
more palmy days, than at the very time when Weis
haupt organised his “ Illuminati." It was then
patronized by Kings, Admirals, General*, and people
alike. Even Prot. Robison, aeerites Weishaupt ot
the greatet dishonesty and bypoensy, because be
had stolen the design and reputation of Free Mason
ry as hit avowed purpose. It it hart been a wise
opposition to mere! societies in general, an I to the
great principle ol secret St social loo, Ih.t directed
this opposition to and piosrnption ot the Illuminati,
then would Miioniy have come in for a share, amt
ft ton must have sudrred the tor-e and effect ol legal
opposition ,
The existence of secret societies u trac eable in
tb* history of the world in unmistakeahle lines for
many hundred years, and this is the only on»
instance in which any has been thought worthy of
death at the hands ot the civil government.
Ot the idea in tbe charge yet remaining, to wit,
capability of favoring Infidelity, we have only to
say that every prtneiple of our institution is at vari
ance with it. AU our tearhiwg* ate draw n from the
Bible, and its God is revered ,, tf,* fountain ot all
truth and excellence. No lnhdel can be an Odd
Fellow.
It w a*el "* You have so maoy bad men among
you it is no ptsee for a ehtistian, or a decent man."
We ate free to admit that lucre ate some men
• ho heai the name ol Odd Fellows, and who arv in
pomessron of our secrets, who are unworthy tbe
confluence that has been placed ia them But we
•ak where ia the society or church numbering

quafiflewltow of Mr* imhhriiow, sad you «|N fcad
m great delinquency ia Mm church w ia Odd
Fellowship. That if, tea if tfcfi Odd Fellows do Ml
do iba datsas which the laws aad usages of ow Order
require of oor Mahore, a* well » the area her* of
rho church discharge the duties that the discipline
of I heir <WttsaissdM and the gospel require. But
id palliation of the (set that we bare some had arn
aaoog us, let ua look at the means we employ lo
keep bad men out. 1st. We require a aaan to get
j some member to recommend him ae a sui I able per
[ son to he initiated into our society. M. The propo
| sition is refened to a committee of three, neither of
| whom shall be the recoin mender, and it ia their duty
[ ,n investigate the character and qualification of the
I applicant, and two of them must agree with bis
recooimeader, that he it a suitable person to become
: « member, and so report to the Lodge “ favorable ”
i to hi* admission. M. He must then pats the test
I of a ballot, with balls, and if there are “ two black
halls the candidate ia absolutely rejected ’’
In thru way hundred* hare been denied admission
who hare desired it greatly. But that we hare no
special liking for '• bad men ” may be prosed hy
the provisions we hare made for the charge, (rial,
snd expulsion of our members if found guilty Any
member may charge another with a crime, and a
trial take place, and if he aball sustain the charge,
may demand the punishment of the offender against
nur laws. I know it it sometimes said that we dare
not expel our members for fear that they will betray
our secrets. By reference to the statistical tables
of the last year it will be found that this power has
been egerrtsed in no leas than seeea hundred ami
fiOy-one instances, and at a proper time the names
and offence of each will be published for the infor- j
mation of all concerned. It is Irue that some lodges :
are not as strict in their government as they should
be, but in most esses where we hare nnworthy
members retained in the Order it is with the hope
of reformation, for it is our principle that we should
nevsr cut off 1 member until every effort has been
made to reclaim the wanderer. I therefore ask what
more could we do to keep bad men out, and getting
them even with aH mir precaution, what more could
we do than •• turn them out But this objection
is urged sgaintt us as Ihoc-rh we aie sil bail men.
We would remind our opponents that we have a
:reat many good torn among us—some whose
diameters are nol only unimpeached but unim
>eachabic—men who in Ibeir church are the strik
ng exemplification of practical piety—men whose
noral integrity, well trained judgment, and high in
ellectual attainments entitle them to (he confidence
ind esteem of all wtho know them.
Finally, we are opposed because of the alledged
uiperduity of our Regalia, Emblems, and Lodge
fixtures. We use our Regalia aa marks of our grade
in the Order. The colors are significant of the
icRtee taken, and its sentiment: the white, purity;
the red or scarlet, love; the green, remembrance;
blue, friendship. Aside horn these symbolic designs
rd our regalia, there is a moral influence in it that
must strike llie mind of every honest person that
views it. Who has ever witnessed a procession of
Odd Fellows Without being impressed with the
appearance and beauty of the regalia—with its
simplicity amidst all its gorgeousness and richness ?
W’hcre is the Odd Fellow that ever looks upon the
regalia he is entitled to wear without remembering
with interest and pleasure the responsibilities of the j
degrees he his received? And especially is this true
if the person has attained to the highest degrees of
the Order. What Past Grand can look upon his
regalia without remembering the responsibilities it
places its wearer under ? Where the Patriarch who
ever wears hia clothing of “purple and gold.”
w ithout remembering the Jen commandments, the
golden rule, hospitality lo the stranger, toleration in
religion and politics, and the vanity and perplexity
of the pursuits of this present world ? This, then,
is the mystic effect and design of our regalia. Who
dare gainsay our using it!
Our Emblems supply equally as valuable a place
in oil; Order as rh* regalia These all teach US
some great moral sentiment, some truthful, beautiful
mo'to of forcible effect. An example in explana
tion may not be improper just here. I presume no
single emblem of our Order has excited moreinqtiiry
and speculation on the part of the uninitiated than
lb« Rant's Horns. 1 have frequently heard it made
the subject of many a runout inquiry by persons
who have looked on prorrssions of our Order. Yet
Hits same emblem of the Ram's Horns is one of the
roost beautiful ot emblems. It is an emblem that
exhibits the power of taith. " They remind us of
the safely connected w ith the horns of the Altar of
find—the success which followed the blowingofthe
real's horni. when the pne*»s walked around the
city o4 Jericho, carrying with them tire Altar of
God, and moving by the direction ol Heaven. And
they admonish us lo beware of every depar ure
from God's service, ami illustrate the mifiortant
doctrine that the prn*{<en!y of our Order can be per
pefnated only while we xuppoct the institutions of
Religion.”
aii oui en,meins eie equally aigriihcant ■ it.! m
■(rucfive. The objector may ask why have you
selected aiich lingular emblem* to eipreti your
moral sentiments ami mottoes J o tbia we reply,
lat. Because they are scriptural, therefore proper
'We have nondtbut scriptural emblem* ) 2d.
R-c»ci*e they are runout, an.) thi» will beget inquiry,
ami inquiry must alway* prere«ie inatrurtion.
It is useless lor me here to attempt an trplanaltnn
»t all our emblem*. This has alrearty heen done
ami published in the Ark —page 175, vol. 3d.
The beautifully appointed adornments of our
lioitge room* hire al*n a good effect upon our mem
her.*. Our neat and tidy room* inspire at with that
self-respect that every man owret to himself. Ami
It ought to give our enemies a good opinion of nt;
and it would do so if they would only think. Sup.
pose we met m lonnit without ary eonvenienee or
comfort!—our opponents would say, then, their
Lmdge roomt look like a •* bar room,” a "grog shop,”
and thus they would complain; but seeing we have
avoided that objection, another lias suggested itsell
that we have too much superfluity in our Jxsdgr
fixture*. |f you pas* by a dwelling, and the fence
M broken down, the window shutters hanging by a
single hinge, the place of one ot the columns of the
portico supplied by a rough piece of a rail, the place
of one of the panels in the door supplied by a piece
of a “store hoi,'’ the shrubbery broken down and
eaten up by the beasts, you would say that that w as
the dwelling of .ndotenee amt some penurious vice
But if you pass a dwelling where all is good repair
—shrubbery green and sni.mtldy trimmed —the
fence in repair—the door yard clean and tidy—-you
say there is the abode of sobriety, industry and
virtue. We only ask you to judge by (bis rule as
to our Lodge airaogementa, and we will willingly
hear oft the censure you will put upon us

TIm situation ofa married and anauuried fiadt,
it moat ba confessed, it vary unequal—ths former
having greatly the advantage in the acala of earthly
happiness; and tbs world nakra tba distinction atiil
more unequal than natara intended it. At thirty
the married woman is considered ia the nooo of
lile, while tlw single woman it looked upon passed.
Again, the wile baa leas necessity to depend upon
intellectual pleasures aa restntreas against the lassi
tude of eanai. She has duties to perform let bar
station in Hfe be what it mav. to which the single
woman cannot torn to rare the monotony of ber
existence. The nation, if she be a mother, will
find a sufficient stimulus to keep up or revive, ia &e
early instruction which It ia one of women's
sweetest privileges to give her offspring, the
, knowledge sad accomplishments which she learned
ia her youth. > >
What pleasorv can be higher or more unalloyed
j to 'he bestower—what light more endearing to the
; beholder—than a matron, over whose brow the
shadow of time, like that on the dial, has passed,
vet ten much of the sunny light of life behind, lead
ing her fair daughter to emulate the grace, of which
i she herself is so fair a pattern ? Or to mark a son,
; in *tl the pride of yontbfnl manhood, paying back
with lore, little short of adoration, the cares of ber
whose gentle instruction first lured him to seek the
wide paths of knowledge, and at who«e knee his
infant prayer was fust breathed ? Other feelings
grow eold; other memories pass away, but the
gentle image of the mother who hat watrhed our
rhildhood—her love, her unwearied devotion, wilt
forever be mirrored in l!*e human heart.
The Pint HVdrfiay.— Major Noah, who in spite of
his ye>r*. is stilt •• a whole team ” ia lore matters,
thus beautifully ard philosophically discourses upon i
“ the first wedding." Read the sketch, old bache- j
lors if von csn. without having your mouths water:
“We like short courtships, and in this Adam
•fted like a sensible man. He let! asleep a bachelor,
and awoke to find himself a married man. He j
appears to hare popped the question almost im
mediately after meeting Md’lte F,ve, and she, with- j
out any flirtation or shyness, gave him a kiss and j
herself. Ofthi* first kiss in this world, we have had, j
however, our own thoughts, and sometimes in a ,
poetical mood have wished we were the man • wot
did it.' But the deed is done—the chance was ■
Adam’s, and he improved it.
We like the notion of getting married in a garden. ‘
It is in good taste. We tike a private wedding 1
Adam's was private. So envious beaux were there;!
no croaking old maids; no chartering aunts and -
grumbling grandmothers. The birds of heaven were 1
the minstrels, and the glad sky flung its light upon
the scene.
One thing about the first wedding brings queer
thoughts to us, in spite of scriptoral truth. Adam
amt bis w ife were rather young to be married—some
two or three days old according to the sagest specu
lations of theologians—mere babies—larger, not j
older—without experience, without a house, with- !
out a pot or kettle, nothing—love and Eden:"
(•> The Albany Knickerbocker gives the follow
ing rules of a boarding bouse in that city :
•• Boarders are requested when they retire late to
take off their boots before getting into bed.
•• Making faces at the landlady not permitted.
“ When a gentlemen has eaten sufficiently he
should leare the table without gluttoning until he is
obliged to unbutton bis vest.
“ Whittling in the pallor prohibited when ladies
are present.
“ Any infraction of the above rules will lead to
the suspension of the infractor's coffee at breaklas!
on the following morning."

4 MONO Ihe nuny diKottiin which are adding
•i*. to *•>« bl.ssings of the present generation, the
undersigned confidently assures |hc public that he
has in nis possession ■ remedy lor that dreadful
disease, called Cancer, hitherto' deemed incurable.
This remedy is known to be ceitain in ps happy
eCects, if timely application is made, before the
disease reaches internal organs or tho case aggra
vated by improper treatment. This^snedieme has a
peculiar chemical affinity for cancerous deposit—
refusing, at the same time, to act on the aunound
mgjparts—and, while eatraelingthe Cancer.it com
pletely remove* every part and particle of cancerous
affection, *o that when a cure is performed, it is a
life-time cure, and no patient need fear a return of
the disease—which invariably happens from the use
of the knile, and other professed remedies.
This wonderful remedy was discovered by Or.
R Shepard, of Verm >nf, and ha« been auccesalul in
hundreds of formidable and aggravated cases, ami
is free from all mineral or vegetable poison, and has
been applied with aalety and sucres* to Cancers of
the Tongue. It cannot be too forcibly impressed
on those afflicted with Cancera to make early ap
plication, as delays aie dangerous, and prolongs the
cure.
Numerous testimonials and certificates may be
seen, attesting the efficacy and efficiency ot this
medicine tn treating every variety and description
of Cancer.
