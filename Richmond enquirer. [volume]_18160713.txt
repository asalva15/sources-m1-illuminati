Norfolk. July 9.
SrECiK PavMEMts—We are tru'y
concerned to have the information, which
we had previously received upon this sub
ject, confirmed by the Enquirer of Satur
day. The Legislature will not bee nven*
td. The banks, we think, cannot, under
existing circunn.ta ic< s, resume specie pay
jn nts on the 15th of November. To guard
themselves against misrhief, thry must ca’I
,n all their notes, that is. by compelling the
l ,, tyment of all their debts before that day.
C-tn this be done without infinite distress,
and perhaps ruin to individuals. Suppose
the debtors of the banks should refuse pay
ment, (and perhaps some may from ne
cessity) the situation of t'.ie banks will be
critical indeed, as they cannot h ive the
same summary process, as may be had a
jriinst them. We would most earnestly
invite the public attention to the state of
tilings which will arise, if the legislature
are not convened : the inconvenience to
which the numbers may be put, tan be n<>
object compared with the public mischief
Air- ady business moves heavily or., but
this restriction will give it a final stroke.
I^t-i it not he supposed that wo arc advo
cates for permitt ug th** banks t:> withhold
specie payments, ad libitum—it is toe junc
ture that cxe.itts alarm, and a tVw months’
delay, would, in ail probability, avert the
* evil apprehended. [Ledger.

BANK PAPER.
The hanks of tit's town at this time,
mi l have for some time past been rechi~ing
their circulation, consequent y they pay out
none of their own paper ; but that of the
banks of Washington and Geoigetown,
(principally) which paper when prt sett*.* d
at the banks north of the Potomac will
rot he redeemed, (hy some at least) ex
cept in such p.-per as the banks hcie will
not receive—c nsequently the banks there
tax our banks with the citculation Zz giving
currency to a paper less valuable than A •
lexandria paper, but which answer* the
same fiurfiosr, as our banks give curren
cy to it. The Geogctuwn banks then
have no occasion to curtail ; and the hrtj~~
Jeers there have by this means been en bled
to carry on nti extensive business, and de
preciate certain country paper which is
thought to he fully as good ..s l.itir own.
There is another circumstance worthy of
att*ntion in the course of exchange, busi
ness which has bee.n introduced by' the
brokers—In Baltimore where district pa
per is pretended to be deprec’uted three
per ernt, specie is higher than it is here—
In Ri hmond our paper is at 12\ discount,
and Virginia paper can be bought in cuan
tlties for 7 per cent ailvrtnc.e, and *at Fred
erick sbuvg for five and six percent, and
in New-York where the exchange is 12 or
14 per cent against us, specie is nearly or
quite as high as it is here. \_Hcrald.
A DECISION.
JustTe Hoffman decided on Monday la it
that all the stockholders of unincorporated
banks were partners, hound jointly and
severally to p-iy ail such paper as might
be issued by the company or representa
tives of such company. This was a case
wherein Alexander Sangs'er was plaintiff
and cei t tin stockholders of the Men hunt’s
Bank defendants. Yesterday the plaintiff
was put upon h:s <lt fence 1) fore the same
court, as a directer and stockholder of the
Ri al Estate Bank, and confess -d judgment.
This appears to be one of Mr. Jefferson’s

N Kw-iORK, J uly 6.
The fortieth Aniversary of the Indepen
dence of our Country was celebrated in
this city on Thursday in a stv'e of magnifi
cence worthy of the occasion. In the pro
phetic language of the vener ible J hn
Adams, written on the 5th of July, 1776,
it was “solemnised with pomp, shows,
games, sports, guns, balls and Illuminati
ons.” The only strife p-rreptable between
tiie two great political parties, on this day,
was who should most distinguish themselves
in its celebration.
The weather was uncommonly fine, and
the citizens who joined in the processions
were almost numberless. Ora*ions wire
delivered at the church in Spring-S'reet,
by Charles G. Ferris, Esq,; and in Wash
ington Hall by 11. Gardenier, Esq. to crow
ded auditories.
In the evening the theatre was brilliantly
illuminated ; splendid fireworks were ex
hibited at Vauxhall Gardens ; every place
of public amusement was opened; and
we are happy to state that no accident
has come to our knowledge which could
have a tendency to lessen tiie general fes
tivity.
’Fhe Military, comprising the first Bri
gade of Artillery, together with Col. War
row’s regiment of Horse, and ( apt. Crock
cr’s company, the whole und* r command
of Geo. Curtcnius, made a brilliant, ap
pearance. The line was form ’d inllu.i

ANNIVERSARY'.
On Thursday, the 40th anniversary of
American Independence, was celebrated
in this city, in a very splendid manner.—
The day was unusually fine which drew
together from the neighboring country ail
ed to our population, an immense c» uenurse
of spectators, to witness the different exhi
bitions. The Military, as is usual, made
a prominent figure among the perfortoan.
i es of the day. The first brigade of ar
tillery, consisting of the 2d n gt. under col.
Stevens; the 9th, under col. Mercein ;
the 19.li, under colonel Kings;and; a bat
talion of the 3d under major Hunter ; the
battalion of governor’s guards, under in jor
Dunscomb, and 5 troops ot colonel War
ner’* regiment of horse artillery, paraded
under the command of brigadier general
Ciirtcn us. The line was formed in Hud
s <11 street, i's right extending through Hu
bert-st. to Washington st. Major General
Srott.of the U. S. army, having been invi
ted by Gen. Minton, to attend the review,
received the salute of the line in 1 bulsun
street.—Maj. Gen. Sleddiford, Brigadier
Geys. Map *s and Ward, with their suites,
accompanied the reviewing general. Al
ter the review the troops took up the line
of march as mentioned in our paper of
Wednesday, awl entering the cast cate of
the Park, passed in front of the Cityhrdl,
where the honors of the marching were re
ceived by major General Morton. The
tiof psthen passed down the centre of the
Park, through Broadway to the Battery,
whre tlu-y formed, fired a national salute
and a feu-de-joie, and were dismissed.
Salutes were also fired from Governor’s
Island, from the Narrows, Bedlow’s Is!: nd,
and at Fort Stevens, at Unrig ite o-i the

displayed a beautiful miniature if a 1 tie
of battle ship placed on wh els, and drawn
by six horses. Her port-holes were all <>

were a nu ber of jolly tars all ready for

was elegantly dressed, in honor of the day.

she then immediately weighed anchor and
proceeded to sea.—The common ler of her

The steam-boat Fulton with a number :,t
ladies an 1 gentlemen, and the battalion of
governor’s guards with a choice band of
music, made an excursion up the east and
north rivers and down the Bay. At Vaux

CALL OF THBLEOI3LA.TUKE.
We were about sitting down to express
our sentiments cn this subject, when the
following Queries were handed uu from the
l*ost-Office. 1 hey arc so pertinent to tlic
questi n at issue ; and written with such
clearr.es.', ami as we think, corn etnas#.
that we l* g leave to adopt them as our
own. The decision of the Executive
Council seems to us incorrect. Tne last
query touches a proposition, which goes
to the very marrow of the subject:
FOR TIIF. ENQUIRER.
It being reported that the honourable
Executive Council have had under consi
deration the expediency of convening the
Legislature in time to suspend the law
that will compel the Banks to resume the
payment of specie on the 15th November,
and that they have decided against the
measure, I beg leave to submit the follow
ing queries: ci ns.
Amelia, July 9.
1. Will the meeting of the Legislature
twenty days earlier than the usual time, be
attended with any great inconvenience to
the members f
2. l>t' o sqbjer.t of the cbml'ting me
dium of the country, and of the credit of
the B toks, important to the future finan
cial operations c* the Commonwealth and
to indviduals in general ?
3. Is the second instalment to the Bank
of the United States to be paid on the 1st
January next ?
4. Is it probable that the vaults of the
Banks of Virginia will be drained for that
payment ?
5. I low can the subscribers to the Bank
of the United States procure specie as
cneap as by collecting the notes of the
Virginia Banks?
6. Who, besides the subscribers to the
Bank of the United States, will d live ad
vintage from opening ti e vaults of the
Bunks on .the 15tn November ?
7. Are not the Banks daily withdrawing
their notes from circulation ?
8. Can there be any faar of a rediin
danry or of depreciation ?
9. What benefit commensurate with the
certain inj wry that will be sustained, is
expected from tne operation of the law ?
10. Can it be believed that were the
Legislature now in session they would au
thorise a measure that must inevitably
transfer the specie from their own Banks
to another institution ?
11. Is the change of circumstance not a
sufficient cause for suspending the law in
question ?
12. Was the national Rank authorised
when that law was passed ?
13. W.«s k not expected that the Le
gislature of New York would pass a simi
lar law ?
11 W;*s it not reasonable to suppose that
many of the other states would adopt the
like measure ?
15. Upo.i what grounds can the Execu
tive have refused to convene the Legisla
tor., ?
16. Must they not be sensible of the conse
quences of the operation of the law ?
17. Can they imagine that the Banks will
be so rash as to refuse the payment of spe
cie on tbe 15ilr'Novembi.-f, in the face of a
special act, and thereby give their sanction
to a defunct of the laws of the land ?
COMPENSATION BILL.
No subject, for several years past, has
excited more discussion ; and none, since
the last Congress, as much feeling, as the
Compensation'-Bill.—In many of the States,
public meetings of the people have been
held to protest against it—the Legislatures
ofNew-Hampshireand Hhode-Isiand, have
adopted formal resolutions, against it ; and
in Kentiir.t- v \vhr»rr- rIplsciinn
gress will take place in a few days, many
citizens have made it a test of qualification.
Some of the candidates h ive found it ex
P dient to pledge their best exertions for
the repeal of the law—Not only are John
son and Clay, who seemed rooted, as it
were, in the hearts of their constituents,
opposed by rival candidates—but it is yet
doubtful which way the ftc&les will in
cline.
It is not surprising, that so mu-h feeling
should have been excited on this occasion
The law itself is radically bad.
1. Admitting that some increase of com
pensation was proper—still was it proper
to convert it from a dtily allowance to a
yearly salary ? It it bo said, that this mode
of compensation will tend to cxp'dite and
abridge the business of the session, may
it not also be asked, whether they are not
in danger of falling into the opposite ex
treme ; of slumberiogovtr the public busi
ness, and '* leaving undone a great many
things which ought to be done ?”—B; s dcs,
if the mode of compensation were proper in
itself, is not the amount of it too high ?
2. But if this measure were necrtsnry to
their successors, was it not very indelicate a»
it resp-cted themselves ? Was it decorous
for the r-prcs-nlatives of the people, not
only to lie fixing their own salaries, but
to give it a retrospective operation?
3. And if the measure were proper, as
it respected th t.is'-Ivps, why did they in
crease their own salerb-s, and refuse to
rncreas* those of the other officers of the
government, who w re suffer.tig, like
tbcmselv s, from the allulged depreciation
of the money of the country?—II w can
they reconcile this partiality to their own
interests, to any principle of justice or
dei urum ?
The law ou,;ht tube rep -ahd—and if
th'Te be as mu h good s nse and spirit
m the people, isth-y have g-nerahy shewn,
not three weeks will have fiown over the
next session, before this obnoxious law will
be sponged from the statute book.
Xf It i' Slid. th.*t some diff renc's of
; view's have appeared among the Bulks
t of New-York —Some wishing to fix h duy
for the r sumption of specie payments—
• the others being opposed to jpj such mea
sure.
