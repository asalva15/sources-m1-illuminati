Irom 01. Helena, has arrived here via
Philadelphia. It is supposed that he
reached that port in the ship Phcuix,

* A- our enemies nmy possible attempt to
exaggerate or misrepresent w hat has hap
pened here to-day, I hasten to inform you
that the tacts are as follows:—At lour in the
ademoon, as the king was leaving the
pdace, some niiiitia cried out “ I mg live
ur consti utional king!'* when some guards
de corps, who were near fell upon them
i with their sabres. Three of the militia
were wminded.and the consequence was,
that tiie whole of tbe horse ami loot militia
ran to arm*, and at this momett, ten at night j
n"ollm noise is heard than the picquets oft
the Almanza cavalry patrolling the streets.
The whole was an intemperate art of a few
individuals; but the greatest unanimity now
r» igns among the people and militia a> wed
a* regulars. The imprudent act on the part
of the guards, most probably will accelerate ,
»he suppression of that body a subject for j
some time agitating, for every body wishes i
it. The alacrity shewn on this occasion ;
prove* Ihe cordiality wilh which volunteers
and troops will run to su-taiu the right* of
the King and nation, now identified.”
