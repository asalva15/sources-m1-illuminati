whole ol the money had vanished, ami
that I hr mate whose iiatu « as Joliu (JuroH

not satislaelory enough to commit them

two before alluded to) were accidentally
seen to ••liter the house of one Joseph, a

collected a large party of citizens, and
conducted them to the spot. They sur

’J he system which has ot late been a
dopted by the government, of sending
their ships of war upon* distant expedi
tions, is admirable in every point ot view.
The exhibition of an actual naval force
secures the respect of foreign nations;
who, though they may bejealsus of our
power, yet will not readily violate our
rights. By the same plan, the increase
ot the discipline and efficiency of our
ships, and the instruction of yoiing
officers and seamen, as to the situation ol
foreign countries, and the nature of dis
tant service, are promoted; whilst the
extended commerce of the United Slates
is every where protected from encroach
ment.
An opportunity is afforded by these
occasional visits to the Pacific ami Indian
Oceans, to make discoveries either of
new countries, or of existing customs and
trade among nations but partially known,
which'may be of importance to the sci
ence, the knowledge, and tin* commerce
ot the world. The late accidental occur

of war Alcesfc, which fell in with a gar
land of 1-lands, bordering the Yellow Sea,

of, leads to the supposition that oilier Loo

tunately be discovered, in the same un
explored regions ot the globe. YVe hope
some gentleman ol capacity and general
attainments may he authorised to go i ut

One word, however, by vvay ol preface. I
A. B. begins by saying, that the En-j
