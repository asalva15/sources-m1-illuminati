Oh ! h theri not, when dewy eve
Spreads her light texture o'er the vch,
A gentle Fay that lores to leave
Her moonlight pnjiime in the dale ,*
And where the raptur'd poet fils
Tc vie to the blue niifi Jpreail around,
Acrrfs his mental vifion Jhts
And wraps his thoughts in pence profound?
Oh yes, there is ! vden f.rft J fung,
(Poor jimple b+y ! / knew not then
The carol prankl bv artful t ngue ;
I nature knew, but knew not men.)
She elop'd me refund the neck, and fail'd,
And e'er the da fed meadows led ;
While frolic /port the id ay beguil'd,
To where up*fife the green bid's head.
Upon the grafy *'irf reclin'd,
My rujitc iayi I'd murmuring read;
IVhi fhe /* wanton Jport would hind
My brows with many a jimple weed.
Or if I chcfe,Jle raifdjor me
Deep in the dale a dark alcove ;
And round it planted many a tree,
Andchoicjiflow'rets that I'd live ;
And thlt '•rr jhe the rmndhine brought.
And there the laJyfmjck (he twin'd ;
A den fled Jr at Jhe djlfy wrought,
And near it taught a nit to wind.
Oh happy days / wth her id revr,

Or, fl: ping m my fav'rite grove,

Cbarafler of Daft or Smollett.
The perfon of Dr. Smollett
was (lout and well proportioned,
his countenance engaging, his
manner referred, with a certain
air cf dignity that Teemed to in
dicate that he was not uncon
feious ot his own powers, lie
was of a difpofition fo humane
and generous, that he was eref
ready to ferve the unfortunate,
and, on fome occafions, to am it
them beyond what his circum
flances could jullify.— Though
Tew coul ! penetMte with more
acateiK'smto charafter, yet none
was more apt to overlook mif
conduft, when attended with
misfortune. IIe 1ived in an hof
pitable manner, but he defpifed
that hofpitality, which is found
ed on odentaticn, which enter
tains only thole, whole fituaiion
in life llattsfs the vanity of the
entertainer, or fuch as can make
returns of the fame kind ; that
hc 'pirdJty, which keeps a debt
or and creditor account of din
ners. Smollett invited to his
plain, but plentiful table, the per
fons \yhofe characters he edeem
ed, in whofe conversation he de
lighted, and many for no other
reafon, than becaufe they Hood
in need cf his countenance and
protection. As nothing was more
abhorrent to his nature, than
pertnds, or intruiion, few things
could render him more indignant
than a cold reception; to this,
however, he imagined he had
fometimes been expo fed, on ap
plication in favor of others ; for
himfelf, he never made an ap
plication to any great man in
his life.
Free from vanity, Smollett
had a considerable (hare of pride,
and great i’cnfibiiity ; his palfions
were eafily moved, and too im
petuous when roufed ; he could
lot conceal his contempt of fol
ly, his deteftarion of fraud, nor
reHrain from proclaiming his in
dignation againlt every inHance
'd oppreflion. dliough Smol
lett poflefled a verfatility offtyle
n writing, which he could ac
:ommodate to every charafter,
had no lupplenefs in his con
duel. Ills learning, diligence*,
and natural acUtenefs, would
have rendered him eminent in
the fcience of medicine, had he
perfevered in that profeflion, o
ther parts of his character were
ill fuited for augmenting his
practice. He could neither Hoop
to impofe on credulity, nor hu-1
mor caprice. He was of an in
trepid, independent, imprudent
difpofition, equally incapable of
deceit and adulation, and more
difpofed to cultivate the acquain
tance of thofe he could ferve,
than of thofe who could ferve
him. What wondsr that a man,
of this charaaer, was not, what
is called, fuccefsful in life ?
