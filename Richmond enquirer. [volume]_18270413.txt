inj* Crowell, n> Fort Michell, to make wh 1 mo
ney he could to pay off the dchle of the firm; .hat,
at that time, Thomas Crowell had a considerable
slock of good* in the nation «■ Fort Mitchell.”
l’age 318 eon'ui.is the deposition of John A
Peek, clsrk to Thotna-Crowell, wh 1 testifies t t
John Crowell, tbe sgtw, first spoke so him to
come to the agency and act a- ckrk, and id'hough
he said at the same time ih it he wan not inter
esterf in the store, yet deponent thought other", i-e,
and lias sometimes thought to »ince;!bat while h«
was acting as clerk, “ the agent was particular
in la iking aver and telling him how things
ought to be done.”
6 m -he lastimony of FI 'my Finch, found a'
page 340, is (he most poi .ltd, full art 1 convincing
upon this point. Ho swears ih it in the year 1821
he arrived in (he Creek nation with a wagon Ir>«d
of goods, hiving previously b- en inform* J by
Crowell the agent, that ha would Tie licensed on giv
ing the bond and security required by law. JJe«
ponrnt S X ears that he offered the bond and the
security required, but agent, to bi^-tieat ntrpr.se,
refused to give him 1 lie iicnnce, and recommend..a
him to sell his goods to his brother Tom Thu
the deponent refused to do, and with n.uch d IT.
cu|ty got a licence for thirty days. At the end
of that time, seeing noth ng was to be done except
unrter cr>y<-r of the Crowells, l.e proposed a par .
tie, <hip to Tom, wh.i referred him to hi* brother,
(hr agent. The deponent accordingly aj pil 'd t
the agent,who immediately arranged the terms oj
a partnership with him, drew up I he articles
signed Tom’s same to them, and ai>
VANCeo HIS PORTION OK TltE MONEY. Till
partnership continued three years, and during ihu
lime the agent gave them decided assistance ir
•heir trade. An instance is mentioned. On*
lkury Spain, s trader in the time of Mitchell
former agent, had a elsirn upon the Creeks fo
£2,000 for goods ere li ed to them. The ageni
{ towell, would give him no aid toward- the reco

the vilest vie (vs ol ambition, and the most daring
schemes of intrigue.
Ask the Editors of the National Intelli, sr,c*r
for tiifeir proof)—f°r th* fitch, by which liny jus
tify their allegations; and ibey will tell you again
and again, of ihe printing of ihe Senate which ,
they have Ijst, of the few se tei.res of Mr. Van ;
Buren, which they have perverted, of lh« inten- !
tion of rewarding him with the office of Vice Pre
■idei.t, or even President of the United States, m
exchange for the thirty six votes of Nevv York
winch he has contracted to m ke over to his
puny, of rumours of a sub.caucus last winter,
and ol a Caucus hereafter, of a few scraps from
two or three newspaper?, and of two or three
toast? at public dinners. This, we repeat, is the
sum total of all the direct evidence which they
have brought forward—to expose (lie selfi h and
unprincipled character of the Opposition. We,
have shown h <w utterly futile is the argument;
which they hive drawn from ihe speech of Mr. ]
Van Buren. Yet their hypoilie.es are even more
i unlouiided than ihe.r arguments.
They would have us believe that the “ great
j Magician,’’ Mr. Van Buren, by some potent spell
| and c mjnration dire, has compelled twen'y foui
of the ablest men in the Senate implicitly to
|“ follow his lead.’’— ft is in vain that the charac
; ter ot tne Senator* defies any such insinuation;
; that the incorruptible Macon, and Smith of South
Carolina, the capacious Ben on, and blunt, honest
• Chandler, are the men to hi drilled by ibis Pro?

I at once set down as the ba*e«t of calumniator*.—.

—nay, President, if he can: They insinuate next,
that he and Mr. Clinton have banned together,
though, under the letter of the constitution, it is
impossible to divide the Empire betweeu them—
and one of them only is to be made President or
V ice President, as one nr the other poet may ** fall
to the lot of N, York.” In truth, *be National

plots; but it is pleased to ascribe to both of tbe-e
genilrnieu ;.n unbounded ambition, to which they
are determined to sacrifice not only the interest*
ot tiieir oun Sta<e, but their own j er-onal rivalry.
Ask the Intelligencer for its proof; and it ha*
none to give. Elite the witches of Macbeth,
they keep ihe promise to the car,but b eak it to the
exp c a ion. They tantalise us with pri o - whi h
«re never produced. They have promised to ex.
hibii the most conclusive evidences of Mr. Van
