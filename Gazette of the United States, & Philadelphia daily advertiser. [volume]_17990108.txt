trbops on board (hip's necessaries and 1
ammunition. A large number of papers
were thrown overboard, after they had fur

reach France, as every one was more or le-fs
irjured in marts and r gg'ng ; add a gale
which occurred next day, mult have put 1
them in a still worse condition for escape
They probably will be captured by our Crui
7.ers on the French Coast, or by some of .

threw a great many things overboard at ,

Off Toulon, on the nth of Oftober was
' seen 11 (hips of the line, which, at firft,
1 were supposed to be Ruffians, but afterwards
found to be Englilh.
Our government are more disposed for '
peace than heretofore —.and a majority of our
legislature are in its favor, since our loss of
the battle at Abuckeir near the Nile. We
flitter ourselves and hope it will influence l
the litti ng at Rafladt to make the desired con- J
clufion.
For four days the Redafteur, and all our
papers have been filled with the official letters C
from Buonaparte and Bert heir, with the pro- <
elamations of the commander ilTued in E- '
sypt- . '
By his letters the army was not dTfcoura
geed by the account of the loss of the fleet, *
but rather enlivened to encounter all dangers c
with their'officers.
The gcnenl's he?.d quarters were at Cairo.
Of prisoners he had only a few ; but the
Camels and Horses he had taken, were reser
ved for an ej<pedition which was a secret.
He ejnbrxed every opportunity to work u
upon the people. An air balloon which he 1
fert up at Cairo, was above the under (land- "
inj of these ignorant mortals. They I •
thought him a meflenger from Mahomf.t.
His Jiorfe artillery had created great von- '
fternation. 1
.1 rlelTenger to one of the Chiefs, bring- ''
iiigan account of a d-.-feat, was asked, " how 11
lar'e is the French army ?"—H" took up a
haidful of land, which he threw up in th>-
air faying, " There count them." f(
i h? general's soldiers divide the booty
which they took from tie Mamelukes; on e
fone they have :found from. 3to 500 Louis l<
d'o, or the value in golcl. c
fuonaparte piftures the Arabians as the w
woft of beings. In large hordes they fwarin
ed ike clouds round his army and harraffed
his rear guards. Plundered and murdered
evey one who fell into their hands. Thev
hav not kept their treaty, which he had
excluded on the jth July, with 13 ofthei 0
Bes. In which it was stipulated, that they s
(linld give him as many men as were necef- <
far to oppose the Mamelukes. And, on' r<
theother hand,, the getieral had promiftd to H
gif them back, after be bad conquered E
fj)t, all the lands which had belonged to i!
tbm. ■
Buonaparte, with these 13 cheilks, set
rdnd a table, where it was further agreed 'I
id determined, that lie who did not fulfill ('■
hi proniife, should incur Hell's fames. J
pobably the cheilks could not ar.fwer for
\nat their hordes did. \ g
Or. ths lath July, Mourat Bey, },A a
t large body of horse troops and batteries .on'
i- thf Nile, and 10 gun boats. From both
i, fides were exchanged more than itoo cannon |
Is (hot. The Turks had already taken 3of our |
le gun boats ; but two of them were retaken j
h and the third burned. After this the army j
was not interrupted on their march. j
r, On the 2111 July, before Cairo, we had a j
it battle. The Mamalukes loft 2000 men I
•- killed [a? ft a ted i;i a Newburrport paper]
n Mourat Bey and other Beys were wounded,
t 400 Camels, wish baggage, and 50 cannon |
were taken. Our army 1 ft thirty killed and
one hundred and twenty wounded. In the
night the Beystiedfrpm Cairo & burned their
ft ships. The people plundered their houses,
C- ;UK ' 011 the iidthe Freuohentered the city,
d The general issued two proclamations:
Buonaparte to the Pheilks, ijc. of Cairo,
dated head-quarters, Gazi, July 21.
r, " iefteraay the Mamalukes were inoftly
e killed or taken prisoners ! I ain in pursuit of ,
the fugitives. Send me the veflels on the ,
other lide of the water, and a deputation,
r acknowledging' you surrender to roe ! Let
bread, meat, straw and oats be in readiness
e for rfly army! Be without fear—as no body j
e wilhes your welfare more than Ido !" (
Buonaparte to the People, of Cairo. ]
e " People ! You have done well not tode
) cjare against me.. ;( I am come to destroy the' j
. Mamalukts—To protea Commerce and the j
inhabitants. Every one who is 'in fear ,
ought to remain quiet ; and they who have .
1 fled may return to their houses ; I (hall efta- \
blilh a divan of perforis, &c.
1 A third proclamation, to the Pacha of the ,
1 Grand Seignior, declares, he may remain ill '
1 his place, and have his effc-as secured to
; him.
Ibrahaim Bey had fled with hisfamiiy and
; effieas to Salchith, where Buonaparte pur
, i.ued him ; but before the. general entered
■ this city, the Bey had left it. Being the last
where frefh water was to be had.
.The Mamalukes have defended themselves
bravely. 1 hey are well dressed and equip
ped.
On the 13th August, when he left this
place, he received the unfortunate account
of the loss of the fleet—Having on the 6th p
July advised admiral Bruey sto come to an- J
chpr in the harbour of Alexandria within
24 hours, if not, to land the artillery, and d
the effc-as belonging to the army. As it p
was the opinion of our engineers, that the
road of Abuckir was not so fafe for the fleet, t
But to his great aftonifliment he was ap- o
prized, 011 the 27th July, that the fleet re
mained there at anchor. He dispatched his t
adjutant to prevail on the admiral to set fail, z
but unfortunately this messenger came too p
late.
The General fays, under his own hand, " v
It seems to me Ad- Brueys would not fail t
for Corfu before he was sure he could not
enter the harbor jof A 1 xandria, or till the 0
array was in such a situation that no re- c
treat might be neceflary. If He has done a- v
miss he has expiated it by his glorious death. /<
Fate, which has sn many inftancet proved c
our superiority on land—has in this, favo- ''
red our rivals on the water.—But as great c
as this misfortune is, it cannot be attributed "
to the unsteadiness ofluck—lt will not leave a
lis ! Wheu I arrived at Alexandria I was h
informed that the English had been '
with a much stronger force than our 9. I
ventured to land in a gale, and was almost g
Chip-wrecked in the attempt. When I
reached the (hore, I threw myfelf on the Cl
ground, (a fignalwas just then given for an Cl
armed (hip, which however, proved to be ''
La Justice) I cried out, «• Fortune ! should 1
thou leave me 1 No 1 attend me only a few
days longer! I marched the whole night,
and attacked, by the break of day, with
3000 men without cannon, or even catridg
es to our guns And in 5 days I, was matter F
of Rofetta and Demenhur which declared dl
me ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN al
EGYPT! hi
In these 5 days our fleet ought, to have t"
been in fafety from the Englilh. Let their
force against us be what it would. But far w
from it! They remained the whole Meffi- U 1
dor, ending July 18, exposed.
They received on tbe firft Ther raidor, ro
(19th July) from Rofetta a supply of rice
for two months—The English (hewed thera. .
telves in todays with a fuperiorforce in these W
waters ; and on the 29th July, our fleet re- ie
ceived information of my conquering and
entering Cairo ; but when Fortune saw that
her favors were not regarded, (he left our Cn
fleet to her own fate. " c
At Radjat, Oa. 25, the fed it io us Con
gress was flill in session. The French Dep- °
uties had sent an ex-press to Paris, for the
Direftury relative to the last propofttions
made to thern; and on this advice, probab
y, ha igs the event of peace or war.
The Ruffian army, which has been march- US
ng to the German Territory, has halted
0 watt the decision of the Congress. This
Hecifion is, it is likely, now about to be 7
nade. tui
PASSAWAN OGLOU. F '
It is but justice to state that our last in- W
formation contradia» the former relative to
this rebel. We now find him (lill in pow- j
er, and it is even said, he has gained a vie !
tory over th? Turks. The Coalition how- °!
ever between Raffia and the Porte, must, ca]
we think, soon operate his ruin.

TUESDAY EVENING, JANUARY 8. y
REFLECTIONS,
On a late publication by Doctor Logan,
Doctor John Logan in his narrative
published in the Aurora, and dated the 2d
January, states among other things
1. 1 hat he did not go to France at the
direction, request, or 011 the advice of any
person whatever.
2. i hat he did not aft, when thdre, as
the agent official, or un-official, of any man
or set of men whatever.
3. I hat he did not carry any message, let
ter or introduaion whatever, from any Citi
zen of America addressed to any citizen or
public body in France.
4. That two certificates of citizenship
which he carried with him, were addressed
to no one.
The firft reflexion which naturally occurs
on reading these fafts, refpeds the extreme
caution used by the Doftor's friends, to pre- 1
vent the possibility of any other person being 1
legally cgmpromitted in his mission. The fe- j
cond reflection is, why, if the mission was
innocent and proper, were such studied pre- :
cautions used to screen his friends from a
(hare of the reputation of his mission. It it
apparent, that the Doctor's friends knew
how near a man might approach treason,
without injury to his neck, in cafe the mea- !
lure should become a subject of legal investi
gation.
It is in no wife probable, that so subtle a
conduft, could have proceeded from the mere !
cogitations of the Doftor's rnibd, unaided i
by the repeated suggestions of men well ac- !
quainted with the law and with the confti'tu
tion. 1 J'
A word or two more particular on what Y
the Doctor fays. J'
r The Doctor fays he did not go to 1
France at the request of any one. But he :
does not fay such a mission was not; suggested :
at kaft by one of the persons who furnilhed
him with his certificates t,f citizen {hip, as a
praise-worthy and philanthropic undertaking -
for a man of fortune. He does not lay, it
was such studied conversations that kindled 1
up his zeal for the service ; and we cannot j ve
expeft, he will acknowledge, that by this p s
covert mode of proceeding he was induced to
propose himself formally for the Negociator. ~
2. ihe Dodtor fays he did not aft when
in France as the official agent of any man or
set of men. This is true, for no man, ex
cept the President of the United States, could n
have Vcfted him with an official character ox
created him an official agent. He confeffes, {
however, that he did whatever an official *
agent Could do, except that of entering into n r'
a Jormal negotiation and treaty. ■ :
3. The Doftor fays he did not carry any coi
Ineffage, letter cr introduction from any citi
zen of America addressed to any citizen or wi
public body in France. But lie does net tell mil
us that he carried no nieUkge or letter from J'
any French citizen or French ex-minister or
consul introduftory of him and his business ;
or that he carried no letter addressed to fotne • j
such loft and degraded American citizen in *~
France as Joel Barlow covering letters which j
were to open his way to thedireaory.
4- TheDoaor fayshecarried withhimtwo
certificates of citizenshipv/Kich were address- 1
edto no one. It is to be wished that the Doc- Q
tor had told us who gave him these certifi- Y
cates of citizenship. One of these certifi- the
cates his friends inform us was signed by the the
Vice-President. It surely does not ccnj- ft»<
within the range of the Vice-Prefidenfs (
funaions to grant certificates of citizenflripT the
Why in this instance has the Vice-President "
usnrped a power with which neither the laws Ph
nor the constitution have vested him ? Was
this certificate to be a token or evidence that
the Doftor belonged to a certain sect, and J
might be fafely trusted by the Illuminati cf
i.!l countries (for it was addressed to no one) •
or was it to Joe in the place of a symbol by
which the direaory might recognise him as
one of the faithful Americans ? It is cer- 12
tainly incumbent upon the Dodor to explain
himfclf further upon this fubjed, and lay
before the public a copy of the Vicc-Presi- T:
dent's certificate of citizen-hip.
Further, everyone knows or has heard of
the unexpected, misttrious and secret depar- V(
tare of Kofciufko far France, at or about
of the time of the Do flor's depakure for tte
• a hum; country. It is equally Well known, at
vc lea ft to many of the citizens of Philadelphia.
>n that immediately preceding this me.norublt
n- fvtnt. the was in' the custom
ic , of making twilight visits to this intriguer
e, j which iometimes went far into the nio ht;
' e " poflible, now, for any person whofc fritd
-- lea is not utterly debased by the dreadful
i- principles ofjacobinism not to'fee an evident
it connection between the Doctor's mission and
le Kosciusko's departure and arrival in France t
r and not to think it probable, that the secret
:s and real object of the mission patted not as
y the Doctor imagined through him but this
le Kosciusko who is well known to.be the bir-d
ft agent of France for effecting Revolutions and
e who arrived in Fiance as soon as the Dodtor.
Again, the public ought to be informed*
n of two late visits made by the Dodor, from.
- which they will draw their own conclusions
1 t!lls 'nt. rmedler, and the ulterior
1 Ps b ' s mission.. One of these was to
. Wilmington in the State of Delaware, where
: the Doctor hid an interview with Hamilton
, Mowan ; the other was to Newark, where
, he saw the French ex-minister Genet.
. I confefs when I take a view of these cir
. cumftances and the whole fubjeft, I have no
. doubt regaining upon my mind, who was the
. prime mover in this misterious and hitrh'y
, Oriminal transaction ; that the perfonageal.
luded to is the grand culprit and the' Doftor
5 the simple instrument, who was to oe brought
; before the public to heighten the drama, or
conceal the author, in case the play did not
succeed. If there are yet men who" entertain
a different belief, they may be compared to
the obftinats old Knight in Rabehis, that
every monmg swallowed a chimera for his
breakfaft.
