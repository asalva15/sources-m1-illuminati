FOR PRESIDENT,
HENRY_CLAY.
VOR VICE-PRESIDENT,
THBO. FRELINGMYSBN.
The spirit of prophecy which seems sim
ultaneously to have descended upon the
wbole corps of Loco L-'oco "penny a liners"
from New Brunswick to Texas, appears to
1e unbounded in its power of exhiliration.
Polk and Dallas are to all essential purpos
es now elected triumphantly there are,to bo
-sure,
some unimportant forms to be passed
through, much like recording a deed when
the consideration has been paid over and
the title passsd to the new proprietor a
mere technical process. Admitting these
dreams'to be upon a substantial foun
dation, let us prepare ourselves for the pol
i«y that will ^follow from the elevation of
the men, which those gifted with this rare
Mcond sightedness, already see clothed with
executory authority.
The annexation of Texas is not the only
•stlieme whose fulfilment will follow the
restoration of the exiled Stuart dynasty to
the high places of patronage and preoga
•five but it will be the first. The hitherto
ansullied banner of the Republic must be
Wretched to its extreme capacity to cover
the multitudinous iniquities of a govern
ment and people, young in years, but alrea
dy gray in sin. The comptroling officers of
OUr Treasury department, with pens fresh
nibbed, must set themselves at work to ex
ecute and issue United States scrip, bearing
«n annual interest of six per cent, to an in*
•definite amount from 5 to 25,000,000 dol
lars, receiving in exchange therefor the in
valuable secorities of the Texan Govern
ment and their reversionary right to nnsar
•eyed and uninhabitable marshes upon the
bottoms of the Brazos and the Neuces,
-with the nominal addition of millions of
acres of granite ledge at the bases of he
Ozark and Cordilleras Mountains. This
will be the first act of this new drama, got
«p with appropriate scenery and decora
tion.
Next comes the Revenue Law of '42 the
aimoon breath of Free Trade must carry
Might and withering to our reviving pros
perity, the credit of the country must pass
through another convulsion and manufac
tures and commerce reel with the shock.
Idle machinery and unemployed laborers—
•tagnation of markets and inertia of capital
herald the advent of this millenium of un
restricted trade. A 20 per cent. Tariff ad
valorem, measured and guaged after the
modeling of John C.Calhoun and the South
•Carolina school of political illuminati must
take the place of the act which has given
life to traffic and credit to the nation.—
What matters all this? If cotton can meet
With sale in Liverpool, and tobacco be
marketed at the ports of the Elbe and Vis
tula free from restriction, let every other
interest of the country go to purchase their
immunities.
Hand in hand with this knocking off of
Ihe ehacklcs from foreign exportations is the
Te-enactment of the notable bill for the safe
keeping and disbursement of the public
-revenue, better known as the Sub Treasu
Ty, with a newly enlisted army of leg-trea
turers, sutlers and camp followers to be
again tethered at the public crib and
gorged to repletion. The old generation of
spoilsmen have passed away but a new race,
no less greedy and grasping must have
their famished appetites satisfied with the
loaves and fishes of public plunder. With a
renewal of the project comes a renewal of
its practical operations, the beauties of
which we illustrate by an array of statis
tics, which shine with a lustre all their
own, in the archives of Mr Van Buren's
administration, than which none other has
•ucb peculiar claims upon the country to
*n everlasting remembrance.

boasting harangues of traveling placemen
and ihc bragging editorials of paid pens,
now feasting upon the dainty crumbs of
office or hungering in impatient anticipa
tion of the repast. The result is in the
hands of the mighty masses of intelligent
freemen, and to those who watch the fore
shadowing of coming events, the election of
HKNET CLAY only waits to become matter
of record.
Taking the confession of the editor of the
Gazette in his last article lie subsides, from
being the principal in the mutilation of the
table of prices published jji onr late num
ber, into an accessary after the fact—a par
tieeps eriminit. The Mornjjig News from
which it was copied, has alntfrdv gained an
unenviable notoriety in this particular de
partment of labor. Its magazine of falsehood
seerns to be inexhaustible. Had it been es
tablished for the express purpose of vitiat
ing the public press it could not have more
thoroughly accomplished its purpose, than
it ha«i. It has lost caste with its own party
the Plebeian even, whose editor will never
endure martyrdom to preserve his rigid
morality cannot square up to its brazen
faced impudence. This maimed and man
gled price list was furnished by the gentle
men whose names are attached, to Mr Web
ster for the sole object of showing up the
fallacy of these reiterated slanders upon the
Tariff, which it most triumphantly does.
We leave the subject. Of all the positions
so boldly taken in his attack upon this car
dinal Whig measure he has rallied to sus
tain this one. With what success others
may judge. We desire no personal contro
versy with the Gazette or its editor—the
original article out of which this rejoinder
grows, exhibited either deliberate fraud or
inexcusable ignorance. If we were severe
on it we were not unjustly so. It is full
time that these distorted facts and pervert
ed statements should havethe wholesome re
buke of truth. It has not been our fault if
it has not been administered, and hereafter
if the editor perseveres in sending out the
"bane" we shall take good care that the
"antidote" follows fast in its footsteps#—
We give below another list of comparative
prices in '41 and '44, which has not under
gone a fluxing process in the crucible of the
editor of the Morning News.

Roorback's Tour through the Southern
States in 1836, has the following sentence:
"Forty-three of these unfortunate beings
—slaves— had been purchased I was in
formed of the Hon. J. K. Polk, the present
Speaker of the House of Representatives
the mark of the branding iron with the
initials of his name upon their shoulders,
distinguished them from the rest."
Admirable representative and embodi
ment of the principles of a party whose
bowels of compassion yearn for the oppres
ed and dovn-trodden of their own color,
but whose sympathy and condolence stop
at the precise point at which political pow
er and the right to vote ceases. We are a
ware that Mr Clay is the owner of slaves,
but we have yet to learn that his yearly
revenue is derived from the profits of negro
breeding and negro selling, nor has he, to
our knowledge arrived to that refinement
in the mystery of ownership, which makes
the use of the searing iron upon the quiv
ering flesh of the victim a necessary adjunct
to identity. It is not enough for this "pure
man" that he deprives his human cattle of
all personal and social rights, but they must
bear upon their scarred bodies the ineffacea
ble records o( his brutality and their degra
dation! Freemen of the United States, by
all means cast your votes for James K.
Polk!
The Texan declaration of Independence
contains the following pregnant paragraph:
"It denies us the right of worshipping
the Almighty according to the dictates of
our consciences."
It would be a meet delicate question in
casuistry to determine what particular form
of worship would be most congenial to the
elastic devotion of madam Texas.
The Barkeepers of the St Croix and
Monona, will please accept our thanks
for their unremitted attention* to this
office.

'For the first time in the history of the
world, solitary imprisonment
George
at
labor for
life has been made the punishment of
actions
that were but the expression of political
opinion."—Bancroft'» letter to the Provi
dence Matt Meeting.
Mr Bancroft's veracity as a historian
grows rather questionable, or his style of
composition is getting to be too figurative
for ordinary understandings. Perhaps how
ever it may be merely an improvement of
modern philology which speaks of the
overt act of Treason as being only an "ex
pression of political opinions." Taking
these softened terms of designation to be a
legitimate engrafting on the simplicity of
•the Anglo-Saxon lexicon, the raising of
troops to resist the legal authority of the
State—the distribution of arms and muni
tions of war, and even the planting of can
non loaded to the muzzle with grape to
riddle the walls of the Arsenal when filled
with human bbings, are nothing but an or
derly and peaceable discussion of fundamen
tal political principles. Nor does Mr Dorr's
improved mode of conducting controversy
stop here after applying the lint-stock to
the reluctant powder which would not ig
nite, and having his disorderly rabble dis
persed by the commonwealth militia, he re
ceives subsequently a reinforcement of des
peradoes from New York, the purlieus of
Anthony street and Five Points. Ascot
hill is seized and fortified by the motley
gathering,contributions are levied upon fo
rage and marauding parties depopulate
poultry yards and pig styes for the susten
ance of this Jack Cade of the nineteenth
century and his desperate associates. At
length the government troops take up the
line of march in force, to disperse the insur
gent mob and the valiant architect of all
this mischief, without a show of fight, be
takes himself to his heels—his eourage like
that of the redoubtable Bob Acres having
"oozed out at the palms of his hands.'
For all this he is tried by a legal tribunal,
found guilty, and sentenced to imprison
ment for life. It is well understood in R.
Island'and elsewhere, that by petitioning in
his own person, he might at any moment
during the session of the Legislature have
his punishment commuted this he refuses
to do. It remains to be seen which has the
greater power of endurance, T. W. Dorr or
the Rhode Island penitentiary. We arc con
strained to admit that Mr Dorr's style of el
ocution is far in advance of the old method,
in point and energy, but we are in doubt
whether any of the sister states will be dis
posed to grant it any greater privileges,
than it has enjoyed in Rhode Island, even
if by refusing it, they should incur the cen
sure of Mr Bancroft in the forthcoming vol
ume of his history. We are not surprised
that Mr B. could not be present personally,
at Providence. When you catch him pol
luting his aristocratic lungs by breathing
the same air of the "Spartan Band" with
out a prospect of buttering his own fingers
by the condescension, for the Leopard to
change hi3 spots will have ceased to be an
impossibility.
Bancroft.—This distin-
guished historian has been nominated for
Governor by the democracy of 'Massachu
setts.
Although Mr Bancroft's name as a histo
rian belongs to the nation, and has already
obtained an eminent celebrity in Europe:
yet, his liberal opinions and lofty states
manlike views, ensure us that when in the
Executive chair of Massachusetts, he will
become as eminent as a Statesman and citi
zen as he is historian and scholar. We be
lieve it to be a very fortunate nomination
and one that has a happy prospect of suc
cess.—Iowa Reporter-
There is not within the boundary limits
of our confederacy a more unprincipled po
litical mercenary than this same George
Bancroft. Originally a whig of the most
proscriptive stamp, but not being sufficient
ly advanced in the direct line of promotion
he forsook his former friends, and scorning
the decent privacy of personal bargain and
sale, boldly threw himself into the market
to the most generous bidderfor political chat
tels. The Anti-Masonic party was then in
the full flush of their evanecent power,and
to them he first made proposals for transfer,
degrading himself by the most pitiful hux
tering, until even their strong appetites
turned with loathing from the bait. Foiled
in this he delivered himself bound hand
and foot into the service of the Van Buren
party, then in the high tide of success, upon
the single condition that he should be put
in nomination for Congress. The compact
was fulfilled, and for two successive canvass
es he was hardly allowed to retreat from the
field with the honors of war. Having failed
in receiving the local purchase money, he
applied to the National Administration and
received from Mr Van Buren the appoint
ment of Collector of the Port of Boston, as
the reward of his perfidy and from that
time to this he has been a common laborer
in the drains and sewers of party filth. By
nature and education an aristocrat, he plays
the sans cullotte for two months previous
to the election, and for the remaining ten
withdraws himself behind the triple steel of
his exclusiveness, with as little real sympa
thy with the body of the people as a Turk
ish Emir or a Persian Satrap. As a politi
cian he is of the "Buttender," and "Pew
ter Mug" school, prostituting his truly fine
powers to the promulgation of the most
Agrarian doctrines and even originating
some of the worst and most disorganizing
heresies of opinion. When in the "Execu
tive chair" of the ancient commonwealth we
have no doubt he will become "owincat a
a Statesman'' but when he attains that posi
tion the falling sky will enable las adit or of
the Reporter to catch larks.

The Gazette.
The personal attack on the editor of
the Hawk-Eye in the last Gazette is so
full of uncalled for malice and is so ob
viously intended to injure us in our
business, as to make it incumbent on
us to say to the editor if he will re*
duce his insinuations to direct and defi
nite charges, we will take some more
appropriate notice of them than we can
now do.
The flights.
After a tedious examination, which
lasted several days, Geo. W. and Geo.
V. fli'IHT were fully committed for
trial on Tuesday last, for the murder
of the German, P. ENDKRES, who was
kilicj in
an last Tuesday
"A Daniel come to judgment, yea a Dan
iel."
We learn from the Eastern papers
that the Secretary of the Treasury has
recently decided that Sumatra and
Java Coffee imported in Dutch vessels
is not liable to duly, while the same ar
ticles brought in in American bottoms
cannot pass custom House without
paying 20 per cent. Mr Secretary
Bibb need not borrow honest Dog
berry's injunction, "but, masters, re
member that 1 am an ass
1'
that truth
is now sufficiently well established.
A FACT WORTH NOTICING. Of the
twelve democratic electors who cast
the vote of New York for Jefferson in
1800, three now survive, Pierre Van
Cortland, James Burt and John Wood
worth, all inflexible Whigs. Two of
the democratic minority in the Senate
are still living, Judge Ambrose Spencer
and James W. Wilkins, both also
Whigs. Six of the democratic major
ity of the Assembly are yet this side of
the grave—five of these are uncompro
mising Whigs. Modern Democracy
is like the Irishman's jack knife which
had first a new blade and then a new
handle, but was the same knife still.
The Mormon War.
We were in Jacksonville when the
troops returned from Nauvooand War
saw on Wednesday and Thursday of
last week. It turned out to be a com
plete Tom Ford humbug and is set
down as such by all. The fruits of it
will be additional taxation on the peo
ple to pay expenses—the killing of
Norris, one of the Springfield Cadets—
and universal disgust at the action of
the Governor.
Sharp, the editor of the Warsaw
Signal, and Col. Williams, who had
both retired to Missouri, and are accus
ed as accessaries to the murder of
the Smiths, held a treaty with Gov.
Ford, and as the Governor complied
with all their terms, they gave them
selves up on Monday of last week.—
This farce would have lasted much
longer, had it not been for the zeal and
promptitude of Gen. Hardin.
HE DECLINES.—Mr Clay does
—to authorize the publication of his
bargain and sale letter addressed to F.
P, Blair in 1824. The coons have re
quested it—the Democrats have dared
him to it but he shakes his head, and
signs "mum." Can any body tell
why?—Mis. Reporter.
Perhaps this is as near the truth as
you could get without stepping too far
out of his beaten track. This letter
is now in the hands of the Hon. B.
W. Leigh, of Virginia and can be seen
by both whigs and locofocos, of which
public notice has been given.
Caution. I
We have heard several complaints of
our citizens about the carelessness of
the numerous hunter* about town.
Game is so very abundant that almost
every man and boy is tempted to try
his skill in quail and squirrel killing.
In addition to the danger of these hun
ters shooting each other, many die
charge their guns so near the dwellings
of our citizens on the edge of town
that the shot frequently strike the hous
es. We learn that one of Mr Kelley's
children was accidentally shot by such
unwarrantable carelessness on Tuesday
evening last.

Oats, Corn, Potatoes and Cash, in pay
ment of subscriptions to the Hawk
Eye.
Col. Hoke the late democratic can
didate for Gov. of N. Carolina, died of
Bilious Fever, Sep. 9th. All party
bitterness is forgotten in a general re
gret for his death. In private life hie
character was most estimable.
"Not all the waters in the rough rude sea,
Can wash the balm from an anointed
King."
Such would seem the impression of the
Sage of the Hermitsge. The last protocol
on the Texas question bears'date Aug- 28th
and was moat unquestionably written by the
Gen. himself. After attempting to fix the
succession upon Mr Van Buren on the Sub
Treasury Scheme and mounting Col. Polk
astride of the Annexation hobby, with the
same result in both cases he may well con
clude that he "holds a barren sceptie in his
gripe."
Stanzas.
When sleep her visioned realm anbars
To thoughts which own its sweet control,
And silently the midnight stars
Watch o'er the vigils of the soal,
And worldly wish intrudeth not
Nor care an envious shadow flings
But o'er the heart's secIudcd spot
A spirit waves its noiseless wings.
A subtle spell comes on my brain, i
My very pulse with joy is mute,
As, soothingly, thy voice again
Comes breathing like a summer lute.
How does thy vivid image glow
In the pure mirror of those stream*
Which all unseen and tranquil flow
To feed the unsealed fount of dreams.

The fWhig mass Meeting In
Jacksonville."
The Whig gathering at Jacksonville,
Illinois, on Thursday last, was a rous
er. On Wednesday evening some of
the delegations from a distance arrived
and the Court House was crowded.—
The meeting on that occasion, at which
Dr A. SMITH presided, was addressed
by Messrs SINGLETON and PARSONS in
a most able manner. The latter gen
tleman has very recently renounced
Loco Focoism and come out from the
Polk and Texas party. He gave his
reasons for joining the Whig party,
by stating that he had always b?en a
democrat and had remained in the so
called modern democratic party, until
he was convinced that they had really
forsaken the old landmarks and were
governed by far different principles
than those laid down by JefTerson and
Madison. He gave striking illustra
tions of these departures from the true
faith* and showed that the Whigs were
contending tor the same measures that
were advocated by the founders of the
Constitution. He said that there were
hundreds in the so-called democratic
party who, like himself, had long
grieved over the departures of their
leaders from democratic principles, but
who clung with such tenacity to the
almost idolized, but much abused name
of their party, and who had so much
repugnance at being chargeable with
change, even in appearance—recoiling
at the certain odium and publicity that
their action would bring upon them
by their loco foco associates—that they
felt unprepared, at present, to break
away from them and join the Whigs as
he had done. During the evening the
Hancock County Glee Club, gratified
the audience by singing, in first rate
style, several appropriate songs.
On Thursday morning the Delega
tions came in from different points by
hundreds. Apple Creek Precinct,
which has been almost wholly given
up to loco focoism, sent a large delega
tion. 1 hey had a hoge car drawn by
eight horses, on the sides and in front
of which were inscribed several signi
ficant mottos, one of which was "Ap
ple Creek is waking up." The car
and two large wagons attached were
full of Whigs.
New Lexington turned on! nobly.
The most interesting sight "from this
precinct was a large car drawn by
eight horses, containing twenty-six
young ladiee, uniformly dressed, each
bearing a banner on which wae inscrib
ed the name of each state in the Union.
The Extter Delegation brought

Naples and Bethel precincts
HARDIN,

largely represented. The latter broush!
with them a car on which were e»!

rious employments, ail at work.
Lynnville turned out well #i.A
One "Old Coon" was busily eng^M
hatcheling flax, while others were
usefully employed in the same wairo?
as the procession passpl along.
The Meredosia delegation attraetoa
much attention sy the introduction intl
the procession of a handsomely ria.2
brig, called the -Harry of the
with a live coon on the maintop, JL
seemed to feel at home among the r£
ging.
AH the other precincts in old M«.
gan were well represented, but
have no room to give full descriptor!
of them. The whole county sesmtd
to have turned out on the occasion.
Scott county, formerly a pari ef
Morgan, sent up over a thousand del,,
gates. Cass, another county set off
from Morgan, was there, too, in llrw
numbers. In addition to these, m«a\
of the contiguous counties were w«ji
represented. They all had numerooi
significant banners and emblems, which
gained much applause as the prom,
sion passed through the streets.
The procession began to form at 10
o'clock, at the west part of town, i*.
mediately in front of the residence of
PORTER CLAY. Esq., brother to Hi*.
RY. The right was given to Iowa..»
This delegation had with them the
Clay Club Banner of Burlington, on
which is painted a very good hkenen
of Mr Clay. As we were not in a good
position to see, we cannot state the ex
act order in which the procession mo*,
ed. It was more than two miles in
length and from the judicious arrange
ment of its route by the Committee of
Arrangements, it made a grand and
most splendid appearance.
After marching from the westeraei.
tremity of the town to the eastern, the
procession began its counter march
little beyond the residence of the Hon.
J. J.
when, after a cirruilof
nearly three miles, it arrive 1 at tin
College Grove. The crowd soon after
assembled around the principal stand,
when the Hon. W. BROWN, Chair
man of the Committee of arrangement!,
announced the officers of the day. Thi
Hon. J. J. HARDIN
Presided, assisted by a large ntnaltr
of Vice Presidents and Secretaries. Mr
Hardin made one of his first rate speech
es on taking the Chair, and then intro
duced Mr Brown, one of the Whig
candidates for elector, from Vermillion
County, who made a most excellent
speech, which was, however, inter
rupted by a call to dinner.
Ample provision was made for the
vast crowd, and much credit is doe to
Capt. John Henry, who superintended
the Barbecue, for the judicious arrange
ments of the dinner tables and the one*
ner in which it was barbecued.
After dinner, Mr Brown resumed hil
speech he was followed by Mr Lin
coln of Sangamon who, of course, made
an excellent speech. At another sund
Mr Woodson, another candidate for
Whig elector from Green County, made
a very able speech. He was followed
by Messrs Vandevener of Brown, Fer
guson of Sangamon, and Blackwell of
Schuyler. At another stand Joab Wil
kinson addressed the people.
A little before sunset the' assemty
adjourned to meet in town in the em
ing. The meetings in town—both ia
the Court House and Town Hall
were ably addressed by gentleoa
present.
The whig young ladies of Jackson
ville had a large party at Dr Zabris*
kie*s during the evening of several hun
dred ladies and gentlemen. The sup
per provided for the occasion was a
superb affair, and all the guests wfrs
highly gratified with the entertainment.
Our limits forbid giving suchf ff flolie*
of this party as it deserves.
The celebration passed off4admiraMy.
There were from twelve to fifteea
thousand on the ground, and this must
be considered a very large namb&r
when it is known that there were very
fe*r present from distant counties.
yGov. Ford's Mormon War kept
great many from attending. Tb«
Springfield Cadets, almost all of wboffl
