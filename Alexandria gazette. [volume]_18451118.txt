PRKLIMLY \ HY PIIOSPF/MTS OF THU
GRAND POL! !T’\L RAILWAY.—PEEL’S
JJYR. —1'!tis lin 'i-proposed t> open a direct
communication between the Whig and Troy ter
mini, with branches to numerous points on
(he high conservative road, and extensions into
several of the liberal provinces. The great dis
position that has recently been shown for an ap
proximation between the two great extremes of
rartv, has rendered this line o national necessity,
and, indeed, it is intended to do, by a direct
course what has hitherto been partially attempt
ed in a roundabout mariner. It would be easy to
•how a statistical statement of the traffic that may |
be expected upon this line, for it is calculated j
that it mu*t be greatly frequented by members
of ParlTament, il.o, instead of taking their pr,.,-1
riples and other heavy goods bv the usual cir-,
cuitous route, a-'ross a vast tract of political,
countrv, will at once avail themselves of the ad
vantage* that Peel’s line cft.-rs to them. The
around ha* been surveyed; an<l, though tue
era fields are severe, the difficulties may be over
i orne, -o as to prevent the ups and downs on the j
line from being too suddon and precipitous. It,
).:»* been calculated tint corn alone will cause a
tremerdous traffic on the Political Railway; oc
casioning a constant trnn-it, to and tio, hotwien
nearlv everv point on the projected railway.—
There wifi he no difficulty about the cuttings,
for tlie fact of it* being Peel's line i- a puarantc e
that be will make hi> cuttings as short as possible
?»io-t of the prisons located along ‘he I olitieal
line are believed to be decidedly favorable to the
propose 1 railway, beoau-e it admits of a lapid
transition from one point to another, and hark
again, if necessary, without inconvenience, 'i he
only opposition that i* anticipated will probably j
ori-e from the agricultural interests, which are |
olway* slow to move, and have b* en ptejudioed i
against Peel's Line; hut it is hoped that, by put j
ting some of their friends upon the direction, and
giving them an interest in tho success of the
scheme, their hostility will begot rid of. Ap-|
plication- for shares, which will only be allotted j
to those who h ive parliamcntrry scrip in some |
of the e->tablisb> d political lines may be n arle to

of this country, who have risen Item obscurity,
says: j
Who was Benjamin Franklin? A tallow
chandler's -on.' N t", f rankun livai., i>* a m iu
hovel, made candies for you to light up youi j
splendid mansions.” ^ •
.Now Bcnj imio Franklm might !,e the son » t ,
a tallow chandler, without being obscure. His j
father was not dj-uingui^md. But Benjamin j
Franklin did not “live‘in a mean hovel.” He*
was born in a very pleasant "two story” houv,
in .Milk street, Boston, about opposite the Oid
South Church. 'I he truth is always tnoujt.—
The great men ofthis conn ry have been g.cat,
not in right of parents, or of executive's tavors,
but by divine right, the blessings of Providence
on ttieir own exertions. \ ery lew came from a
hovel. Most of them rose from the middle ranks
of life, where the upper is not high, according
to European calculations.— L. S. Gazette,
A PUPIL OF FEME LON.—Dr. Way land,
in his admirable illustrati >ns ot the laws of vt- |
raeitv, refers to a beautiful story of ihe Duke ol :
Burgundy, a pupil of Fcnelon, which is wortny 1
of being had in continual remembrance. Short- j
iy before*his death, he was present at a cabinet
council, in which it was proposed to violate a j
treaty, in order to procure important advantages \
to France. Iteasons ot state weie ottered in !
abundance to justity the deed uf peifiuy. I tie j
Duke of Burgundy heard them all in silence. j
When they had finished, be closed the confer- |
ence bv laying bis hand upon the instrument, ;
an 1 saving with emphasis, “Guilt tntn% there is a
treaty.” This single sentiment is a mure glorious
monument U> t»is tame tnau a column inscribed
with the record of an hundred victories.
SUBMISSION.—Health m*j be enjoyed;1
sickness must be endured; one body is tue object ,
of both, one God the author of both, ll, then, i
he gave me health, 1 will thar.ktull} e,1j 'J
and not think it too good, since it is his mercy
that bestows it; if he send sickness 1 will patient
ly endure it, and not think it too great, since it j
is my sins that descrse it. If in my health,!!
will strive to preserve it by praising him; il in,
sickness, 1 will strive to remove it by praying to ;
him. He shall be my God in sickness and in |
health, and my trust shall be in him in health anc. ,
in sickness. So in my health 1 shall not need
to fear sickness, nor in my sickness despair ol
health. ____

SANDS’S SARSAPARILLA.—For the Re

arising from an Impure Stale of the Blooe or

is now used and universally approved bv the
most distinguished of the Mcuieal 1 rofessum
throughout the country, and by its m rmsic med
ical value, the public generally (but Lie afflicted
particularly) have been made acquainted with its
usefulness,'in the removal and cure ol diseases
bavin- their orig n in an impure state of the
Mowl ri he parilla is combined with other
ingredients, all ot which are held in the highest
estimation by the most distinguished physicians
for the removal and permanent cure ot the fol
lowing anil similar maladies:
As a mild aperient, antiseptic and tonic, it
contains the three most useful properties of
medicine. It purges, purifies and restores —
Scrofula, Cancer. Leprosy, all Ulcers and Scrof
ulous Sores, all Diseases of the Skin, and all in
ternal disorders not organic, but springing from
a diseased circulation, give way before its hyge
ian influence.
The following certificate exemplifi"*, in a
most remarkable manner, the great medical val
ue of the Sarsaparilla in a severe ca*«e of Scrof
ula. It speaks a language not to be misun
stood.
Nkw-Hedford, Moss. Feb. 20,1SL>.
Mr^rs. Sr:m!s:— Fight years ago last March, I
had what is called the black measles, and the
fact of my blood having been in an impure Mate
for many years previous, without doubt gi \»t.\
aggravated the disorder, and has been the cau*e
of manv severe a til ictiuns since j the fii M o 1 \> hit h
w as an' inflamntion in my head, causing total
KliM.dMess for nearly two years and a halt, and
at the same time ulcers in my throat that con
tinued to rat until my palate was entirely con
sumed All this time I was under the treatment
of physicians without receiving any benefit from
them!! until through the kindness and skill of Dr.
ttarlette, mv sight was restored to me. Still all
my other complaints continued the same, ami,
iti addition to tin- ulcers in my throat, sores broke
out on my bead and ears, causing dealness, atten
ded with a severe cough and tli i cully oi breath
iug, hoarseness, &.C.—My sufferings for more
than two years were almost insupportable, and
at length, by the advice of Dr. Ford, 1 ir.du j
ced to iv Houck’s Fan ace a, the c licet ol wnii h
was to remove the sores lioiu my throat to my
shoulders, which began to swell, and on which,
f«.rmed hard tumors, accompanied with extreme :
pain and tenderness. My head and. thro.»t soon
grew worse than ever, and my throat v.a* so
soie that it was impossible lor me to take medi
cine, and my disease continued to rage ami in
crease to such a degree that 1 could no Iom„* i
sit up, and for mouths 1 was confined to my bed.
The cough still continued, and a kind ol sibuy
water ran constantly from my moutn, my btuuth- ^
iirg also became so diilieu!t 5h it 1 could bt In >*u
all over the house. Solt tumors a so fotmed
upon my head; my tongue and gums swelled |
and turned white; twelve pieces oi my uppvi
jaw bom-, together with six of mv teeth, drooped ,
out at different times, and my situation had now
become so dreadful, and my agony so intense, !
.i . mi .... a ii 11 I v tiir.rv I. me.
and l gave myself up to' die: 1 begged ami
prayed that God would take me to himself that
! mijit be rel.eved from my sufferings, load-,
ilition to all the rest, 1 now began to suffer from j
the effects of hunger, and it was with the great
est difficulty that l could swallow any thing at j
all, not even a little arrow root gruel, ami this j
did but little to satisfy the cravings oi hun
ger.
Hut notwithstanding the great extremity to
u hieb 1 was reduced, it seemed that my life was
to he spared, and for what, is best known to my
Creatin'. At this time my elbows began to get
sore and swelled very much, and several sores (
broke out on different parts ol my arms, which :
had the appearance ol small biles, and which
when opened, discharged matter that seemed to
poison the parts wherever it touched. I had j
seven of these sores on one arm. and live on the !
other, and at last th y all ran into one on each
arm, and ate into the bone. In the mean time l j
had tried vutious remedies, but all to no purpose,
as it seemed impossible to stop the ravages ol
mv disease. I now became utterly discouraged,;
despaired of getting relief, and gave myself up a>
incurable. About this lime a paper was thrown
into the house which contained a certificate of
a cure performed in a case similar to mv out.
bv Sands’s Sarsaparilla, and calling the attention
of one of mv friends to it, she ^aid "he would buy
me a bottle and see what effect it would nave. I
had not taken half of it before 1 was satisfied that
it would either kill or cure me, as the sensations l
experienced were so strange and indescribable
that l knew a change either tor the better or
worse was coining over me. Before the first bot
tle was entirely used, a tine tetter came out all
over me, and i began to feel stronger, and was
sensible it was doing me g< od. 1 have now used
six bottles, and 1 find myself a new creature.—
The sores on my arms are healed, and the tumots
on my head have all disappeared: my head has
also resumed its natural hardness, and the dilii
ri|!tv of breathing is in a great measure removed.
When 1 contrast my present situation with
what it was a few months ago, my heart over
flows with gratitude to my Maker lor alibis mer
cies, ami I ftcl it is to you that l am indebted, as
the instrument of Divine Providence, for my
safe deliverance from this severe trial, and shall
always pray that you may be rewarded for your
kindness to me, an utter stranger. 1 desire that
all similarly aillicted may know there is a balm
for their diseases in your invaluable Sarsapa
rilla. Yours in sincerity,
