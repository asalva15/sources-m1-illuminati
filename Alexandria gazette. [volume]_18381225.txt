To the Friends of Education.
Severn! Individuals, deeply impressed
with the importance of improving the
condition of piimary schools in this re
gion, have agreed to meet m Middle- :
burg, Loudoun County, on Monday, 31st
of December (inst.) for the purpose of
discussing the subject of primary and
academic education; anil of considering
the expediency of attempting some 01
ganizution, tor the promotion of this no
i ble cause. All engaged as Teachers in
the Counties of Fairfax, Fauquier and
Loudoun, are invi’ed, and even request
ed to attend; as well as others, who may
be willing, by their presence and mflu
|ence, to encourage the undertaking. If
the various efforts of this enterprising
age are found by experience to profit by
j the influence of public meeting, why
I may not the education of our youth be
promoted by similar means? It is hoped
I that the lovers of science and of our
| common country will take an interest in
| this matter, in some degiee commensu
rate with its importance; and it they
Should, there can be no doubt that the
meeting will be large and highiy inter
i

Shtncooa\i Ulectro Magnetic Remedies
FOR CHRONIC DISEASES.
Of the class Hypertrophy, including all the
forms of Scrofula, viz*
rpUBKRCULAR Consumption, White Sw el
S_ lings, Dyspepsia, Scrofulous Sore Eyes,
Chronic Disease of the Liver, of the Heart, of
the Spleen, of the Kidnies, ot the Spine, King’s
Evil; Leuconlura, Chlorosis, Menorrhagia, or
Female complaints.
These are but different modification of the
same disease, arising from the same cause, dis
tinguished by the same diagnosis, and curable
by the same remedies. '1 heir common cause
is an irregular action of the Electro-CiaUanic
force* in the system; they may all be detected
by pressure upon the sides of the vertebrae and
glands of the neck, which elicits the Klectro
(iilvanic Sy mptoms, and they may be cured by
these Electro-Magnetic remedies The latter
are accompanied by a compendious medical
treatise; explaining the principles of the dis
covery upon which they are founded, and sta
ting the manner in which they are tube appli

the fact that every part of the human body, to
gether with every particle of animate and in
animate matter, is either in a negative or posi
tive state of electricity; and tiiat every motion,
in ail matter, whether in die largest masses or
in the smallest particles, is produced by the
attracting and repelling forces of this universal
principle. The morbid action which produces
disease of the organs or limbs, he proves to be
occasioned by the undue preponderance of one
of these forces in the system, and his remedies
restore health by subduing thisirregular action
loan equilibrium. By this means, the very
seeds of the disease are eradicated, and a per
manent cure effected, even in cases where all
hope of relief from other sources is abandoned.
The Electro-Magnetic Remedies are the only
preparations applicable to this prevailing class
ot disease, and they never disappoint the eon

farm on which he resides, in the
County of Prince William, Virginia, a

jamin Farrow and Col. John Gibson.—
The tract contains 176 acres; one half of

that tfie soil is of unusually good quality
and the situation is unsurpassed by any
in the county.
