' LONDON, ﬂsarch 28.
Letters from all parts of the continent,
mention thevery-uncommon misery as Well
ctas the discontent of all classes of , people.—
Should Bonapartc meet with any reversessi,ss
depend upon it not only Germany, but ltaly,
Holland, and France, will be the theatrcs
of new and I fear, sanguinary convulsions.
That the revolution in Sweden has been ef
fected by the gold and intrigues of Bona
parte, cannot be doubted. The new regent
is known to be an old partisan of France,
and one of the chiess of the sect called
" The Illuminati." One of his victims is
count de Fcrsen, a nobleman, personally in
sulted by Bonaparte at Rastadt, in 17 97 , on
account of his supposed attachment to the
Bourbons. Though a Swede by birth, he
was, before the revolution, a colonel of the
regiment of Royal Suedors in the French
service; and it was he, who, in 1791, pro
cured the present Louis XVIlI. an oppor
tunity to escape by way of Valenciennes
when the unfortunate Louis XVI. was ar
rested'at Varennes.
! Several accounts have been received of
hostilities between Austria and France, but
'Inothing yet official. Poiiticians do not ex
pect here that Russia will join France in a
new contincntal war; but also they do not
hope that she will Oppose the gigantic stridcs
, of Napoleontowards univers-cttl dominion—
siShe will,. nevertheless, not survive, many
years, the fall of Auctsstria.
Several persons have letters from St. Pc
tersburgh of a late date, mentioning some
* changes in the politics of its cabinet: but as
ss long as the Russian messengers come here
by way of France, it wouid be zsilctzsurd to
St ppose at }' thing ver) save] able to thiscoun
try. They may bring some new pacific
proposals in conjunction with France, but
certainly no over-tures for a separate peace
.} ss'ith England.
s
Reporctts continue to circulatc here of in
surrections in Poland, in Switz-si-xh '1,n<l in
the Papal territor), and m Cambria , they
are founded upon the contents oi plizacc
letters from Holland, which also mention

Proclamatz'on of the British general H'ssz'lsixcn,
to the .S'sivuzz'ardsu
Inhabitants of the Sit-rra ! I am come to
join you in the sacred cause which you have
sworn to defend. My duty, my conscience,
and the love of glory, urge me to undertake
any thing, and to make every possible sacri
fice for your interests. The alternate suc
cesses, naturally to be expected during so ss
great a contest, I am positive, have not ;
damped your ardor or depressed your pa- !
triOtism. The evils which have been infiict- !
ed upon .your countrymen by sanguinary iss
gangs of lawless and barbarous vandals,only !
serve to kindle in your hearts a desire to a- !
venge yourselves, and the outrages commit- ]
ted against God, your country and your cap- ]
tive king. The cause, which we empport, is .
too interesting for us to abandon it. lfyou !
should conquer, you would bequeath to pos- !
terity the independence which you have in- ?
herited, and Spain would preserve her name
and distinguished rank among the powers of !
Europe; but, if conquered, Spain will no ?
longer be a power. You shall be subjected _
[to foreign laws ; your industry shall only
serve to enrich the nations plundered by a .
fperfidious Corsican, and your unhappy chil- si"
dren, doomed to a disgraceful servitude, :
shall be, in his hands, the instruments of the
ruin of other countries,the object of his am
bition and covetousness.
Spain Will shake oﬀ the infamous yoke, if
she be firm and steady in her determination:
the armtes of one nation shall ever prove im
potent against the population of another, if
the latter be armed and united to defend its
freedom and independence. What ! are
one hundred and twenty thousand banditti
to subjugate ten millions of Spaniards ?—
.SNO. Ah! if the Spaniards preserved the
Qmory of a Gonzalo of Cordova, of
the conquerors of France, of al Frincis
ss xsi. and of so many other heroes !ho . '

enemy of humanity wants to pcrsuade you,
that his black eagles are victuriom in every—
quarter, and that Engiand has abandoned
.Spain forever. All his victories will short

and the king of England will keep his royal
word, provided the Spaniztrds do not de.
